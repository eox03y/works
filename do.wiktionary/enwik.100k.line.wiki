@ Wiktionary:Welcome, newcomers
$ Hello, and welcome! Wiktionary is a [[multilingual]] [[free]] [[dictionary]], being written [[collaborative]]ly on this website by people from around the world. [[entry|Entries]] may be [[Help:How to edit a page|edit]]ed by anyone!

Designed as the lexical companion to [[:w:Main Page|Wikipedia]], the encyclopedia project, Wiktionary has grown beyond a standard dictionary and now includes a [[Wiktionary:Wikisaurus|thesaurus]], a rhyme guide, phrase books, language statistics and extensive appendices.  We aim to include not only the definition of a word, but also enough information to really understand it. Thus [[etymology|etymologies]], pronunciations, sample quotations, synonyms, antonyms and translations are included.

Wiktionary is a [[wiki]], which means that you can edit it, and all the content is dual-licensed under both the [[Wiktionary:Text of Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License|Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License]] as well as the [[Wiktionary:GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License]]. Before you contribute, you may wish to read through some of our [[Wiktionary:Help|Help]] pages, and bear in mind that we do things quite differently from other wikis. In particular, we have strict [[Wiktionary:Entry layout explained|layout conventions]] and [[Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion|inclusion criteria]]. Learn how to [[Help:Starting a new page|start a page]], how to [[Help:How to edit a page|edit entries]], experiment in the [[Wiktionary:Sandbox|sandbox]] and visit our [[Wiktionary:Community Portal|Community Portal]] to see how you can participate in the development of Wiktionary.

We have created '''{{NUMBEROFARTICLES}}''' articles since starting in [[December]], 2002, and we’re growing rapidly.

==Editing Wiktionary==
People like yourself are very active in building this [[project]]. While you are reading this, it is likely someone is editing one of our entries. Many [[knowledgeable]] people are already at work, but everybody is [[welcome]]!

Contributing does not require [{{fullurl:Special:Userlogin|type=signup}} logging in], but we would [[prefer]] that you do, as it [[facilitate]]s the [[administration]] of this site. (Note that logging in also prevents the [[IP]] address of your computer from being displayed in the [{{fullurl:Wiktionary:Welcome, newcomers|action=history}} page history].)

You can [[dive in]] right now and add or alter a definition, add example sentences, or help us to properly format or categorize entries. You can even [[Help:Starting a new page|create a page]] for a term we’re missing. Please feel free to [[Wiktionary:Be bold in updating pages|be bold]] in editing pages!

How could allowing everyone to edit produce a high‐quality product instead of total disorder?  Because most people want to help, and keeping it open to everyone creates the potential for making many good and ever-improving entries. Records are kept of all changes, so even unhelpful edits can easily be [[revert]]ed by other users. To use a now‐famous [[w:Linus' Law|catchphrase]], in essence: “Given enough eyeballs, all errors are shallow.”

To start out, users might want to use the ‘[[Special:Recentchanges|Recent changes]]’ or ‘[[Special:Random|Random page]]’ link (found in the navigation box elsewhere on this page), to get an idea of the kinds of pages you can find here. (It might be surprising how many non-English words are entered here!)

==Norms and etiquette==
{{xsee|[[Help:Interacting with humans]]}}
One important thing you should know is that we have borrowed from our sister project [[Wikipedia:|Wikipedia]] some [[Wikipedia:Norm (sociology)|cultural norms]] you should respect:
# We try not to argue pointlessly. This isn’t a debate forum. After [[civilized]] and reasonable discussion, we try to reach broad [[consensus]] in order to present an accurate, neutral summary of all relevant facts for future readers.
# We try to make the entries as unbiased as we can, meaning that definitions or descriptions — even of controversial topics — are not meant to be platforms for preaching of any kind.
# Bear in mind this is a ''dictionary'', which means there are many [[Wiktionary:What Wiktionary is not|things it is not]].
# At any point, if you are uncomfortable changing someone else’s work, and you want to add a thought (or question or comment) about an entry or other page, the place is its [[Wiktionary:Talk page|talk page]] (click on the "discussion" tab at the top or the "Discuss this page" link in the sidebar or elsewhere, depending on your preference skin). Note, though, that we try to keep discussion focused on improving this dictionary.

However, there are also some differences between Wikipedia and Wiktionary. If you already have some experience with editing Wikipedia, then you may find our [[Wiktionary:Wiktionary for Wikipedians|guide to Wikipedia users]] useful as a quick introduction.

@ Wiktionary:GNU Free Documentation License
$ The '''GNU Free Documentation License''' (GFDL) is a [[w:copyleft|copyleft]] license for free documentation, designed by the [[w:Free Software Foundation|Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) for the [[w:GNU|GNU]] project.  The official text of version 1.1 of the license text can be found at: http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html

The license is designed for software documentation and other reference and instructional materials. It stipulates that any copy of the material, even if modified, carry the same license. Those copies may be sold but, if produced in quantity, have to be made available in a format which facilitates further editing. 

== Secondary Sections ==

The license explicitly separates the "[[w:GNU_Free_Documentation_License/Document|Document]]" from "[[w:GNU_Free_Documentation_License/Secondary Sections|Secondary Sections]]", which may not be integrated with the Document, but exist as front-matter materials or appendices. Secondary sections can contain information regarding the author's or publisher's relationship to the subject matter, but not any subject matter itself. While the Document itself is wholly editable, and is essentially covered by a license equivalent to the [[w:GNU General Public License|GNU General Public License]], some of the secondary sections have various restrictions designed primarily to deal with proper attribution to previous authors.

Specifically, the authors of prior versions have to be acknowledged and certain "invariant sections" specified by the original author and dealing with his or her relationship to the subject matter may not be changed.  If the material is modified, its title has to be changed (unless the prior authors give permission to retain the title). The license also has provisions for the handling of [[w:GNU_Free_Documentation_License/Cover_Texts|front-cover and back-cover texts]] of books, as well as for "History", "Acknowledgements", "Dedications" and "Endorsements" sections.

== Using the GFDL ==

For a document to be covered by the GFDL, one must include a [[w:GNU_Free_Documentation_License/Copyright and license notice|specific copyright and license notice]].

== Wiktionary and GFDL ==

All Wiktionary articles are licensed to the public under the GNU Free Documentation License. See [[Wiktionary:Copyrights]] for the details. The local copy of the license, as required by the terms of the GFDL, is at [[Wiktionary:Text of the GNU Free Documentation License]].

Version 1.1, March 2000

<pre>
Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>

== 0. PREAMBLE ==

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

==  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS ==

This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

== 2. VERBATIM COPYING ==

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.

== 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY ==

If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

== 4. MODIFICATIONS ==

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

* A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
* B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
* C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.
* D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
* E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.
* F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
* G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
* H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
* I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
* J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
* K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
* L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
* M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.
* N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

== 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS ==

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History" in the various original documents, forming one section entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."

== 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS ==

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

== 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS ==

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.

== 8. TRANSLATION ==

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License provided that you also include the original English version of this License. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original English version of this License, the original English version will prevail.

== 9. TERMINATION ==

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

== 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE ==

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

@ Wiktionary:What Wiktionary is not
$ {{shortcut|WT:WWIN|WT:WIN|WT:NOT}}
Wiktionary is an online [[dictionary]] and, as a means to that end, also an [[w:online community|online community]]. Therefore, there are certain things that Wiktionary is ''not''.

== What Wiktionary is not ==

# Wiktionary is '''not an [[encyclopedia]], a genealogy database, or an atlas'''; that is, it is not an in-depth collection of factual information, or of data about places and people. Encyclopedic information should be placed in our sister project, [[w:Main page|Wikipedia]]. Wiktionary entries are about words. A Wiktionary entry should focus on matters of language and wordsmithing: spelling, pronunciation, etymology, translation, concept, usage, quotations{{,}} and links to related words. 
# Wiktionary is '''not an [[arbiter]] of what is good English'''; correct English, acceptable English, suitable English, or even grammatical. Wiktionary [[describes]] usage, it does not [[prescribe]] nor [[proscribe]] it, and adheres only to its [[WT:CFI|criteria for inclusion]], which state that any term or meaning that can be shown to be in sufficiently widespread use may be included. By including or not including a certain term, it by no means accepts or attempts to promote a certain point of view, but is simply documenting, explaining what '''is in use''' in English or any other language.
# Wiktionary is '''not a [[crystal ball]]'''. Wiktionary does not try to predict which new words will actually achieve use. It usually depends on verifiable proof of usage over a year.
# Wiktionary is '''[[m:Wiki is not paper|not paper]]'''. Thus, Wiktionary effectively has no size limits, can include links, can be more timely, etc. It also means that the style and length of writing appropriate for paper may not be appropriate here. There is less need to exclude arguable entries. If enough people support a well formed entry, then there should be no need to call or VOTE for its deletion.
# Wiktionary is '''not a soapbox, chatroom{{,}} or discussion forum'''. However, there are [[Wiktionary:Discussion rooms|discussion rooms]] to discuss Wiktionary-related topics. 
# Wiktionary is '''neither a [[w:Mirror (computing)|mirror]] nor a repository of links, images{{,}} or media files'''. Any content added to Wiktionary may be subject to merciless editing or deletion. 
# Wiktionary is '''not a free wiki host or webspace provider'''. You may not host your own website at Wiktionary. If you are interested in using the [[wiki]] technology for a collaborative effort on anything other than writing a dictionary of all words in all languages, even if it is just a single page, there are many sites that provide wiki hosting. You can even install [http://www.mediawiki.org Wiktionary's wiki software] on your server.
# Wiktionary is '''not a battlefield'''. Every user is expected to interact with others [[Wiktionary:Civility|civilly]], calmly and in a spirit of cooperation. Do not [[Wiktionary:No personal attacks|insult]], harass or intimidate those with whom you have a disagreement. Rather, approach the matter in an intelligent manner, and engage in polite discussion. Do not create or edit entries just to prove a point. Do not make legal or other threats against Wiktionary, Wiktionarians{{,}} or the Wikimedia Foundation. Threats are not tolerated and may result in a [[WT:BLOCK|ban]].
# Wiktionary is '''not [[w:Censorship|censored]]''' (nor is it [[w:MPAA film rating system|content-rated]]). Anyone can edit an entry and the results are displayed instantaneously; thus, we cannot guarantee that someone will not see or read something objectionable.  In addition, Wiktionary has no organized system for the removal of material that might be thought likely to harm minors. However, entries can be censored by consensus.
# Wiktionary is '''not just for English'''. Wiktionary is a dictionary  written in one language and covering all words in all languages, just as Wikipedia is an encyclopedia written in one language of all topics from all language-areas. Each Wiktionary seeks to define all words from all languages in its own language, so that readers will be able to find definitions of all words in all languages in their own language. This Wiktionary is written in English, so it is in a way an English dictionary, an English-to-anything and an anything-to-English dictionary all in one. Although one could look up {{term|être|lang=fr}} at fr.wiktionary ([[:fr:être]]), its definition will be in French. So if that person doesn’t speak any French, they still wouldn’t know what ''être'' meant, and it wouldn’t be of any help to them.

== Wiktionary is not Wikipedia ==
{{shortcut|WT:WINW}}
{{main|Wiktionary:Wiktionary for Wikipedians}}

Although Wiktionary and Wikipedia are sister projects, '''Wiktionary is not Wikipedia'''. Some of our policies are similar to some of Wikipedia's policies; others are quite different. The way we do things here is similar in some respects to the way things are done at Wikipedia; in other respects, it's very different.

; Differences in content
:* Unlike Wikipedia, Wiktionary does not have a "notability" criterion; rather, we have an "attestation" criterion, and (for multi-word terms) an "idiomaticity" requirement. There are some similarities here — [[w:Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not for things made up one day|neither Wiktionary nor Wikipedia is for "things made up one day"]] — but also some differences. Our "attestation" requirement is much less subjective than Wikipedia's "notability" requirement; and we include all terms in all languages, including very obscure or rare terms, provided they meet [[Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion|our criteria for inclusion (CFI)]].
:* Wiktionary is a ''secondary source'' for its subject matter (words and phrases) whereas Wikipedia is a ''tertiary source'' for its subject matter (topics). This means that while Wikipedia documents what other people say about topics, Wiktionary documents words and phrases itself without relying on the statements of other people. As a consequence, the requirements of verifiability are very different. Verification on Wikipedia asks "can we find a credible source that says it is the case?" while on Wiktionary we ask "can we find real-life examples to show it is the case?". This also means that whereas Wikipedia discourages original research and relies on the research of others, Wiktionary users themselves actively research terms and their meanings.

; Differences in community
:* Wiktionary has a different [[WT:BLOCK|blocking policy]] than Wikipedia, and administrators don't usually issue warnings unless edits can be assumed to have been made in good faith.
:* Because there are so many pages on Wiktionary with relatively little content, talk pages of individual pages are not often used. Instead, discussion is usually centralised in [[WT:BP|Beer Parlour]], [[WT:TR|Tea room]] and other discussion rooms.
:* Unlike Wikipedia, which encourages users to be creative with user boxes on their personal pages, Wiktionary allows only userboxes that are relevant to your work on Wiktionary itself. This includes most importantly [[WT:Babel|language userboxes]], which display the languages that you know.

; Differences in organization
:* Unlike Wikipedia, Wiktionary's page names are case sensitive. [[Hand]] and [[hand]] are different pages. When several pages exist that differ only in their capitalisation, the template {{temp|also}} is placed at the very beginning of the page to redirect between them.
:* There are no disambiguation pages on Wiktionary, and we do not create redirects for alternative forms, spellings or inflected forms of words. Instead, a small stub entry is created with a template that links back to the main form. Many such stub entries are created automatically using various [[WT:BOT|bots]].

; Differences in page format and wikitext
:* Wiktionary has a very rigid page format, detailed at [[WT:ELE|Entry Layout Explained]].
:* Wiktionary makes heavy use of templates for all kinds of things, and each language often has its own set of templates. Learning to use the templates of the language you are working on is very important, and can be found at [[:Category:Templates by language]]. Categories, formatting and linking also often use templates for consistent formatting.
:* Wiktionary uses [[WT:LANGCODE|language codes]] extensively for any language-specific purposes involving templates. For example, many templates use <tt>en</tt> to refer to the English language, or <tt>cmn</tt> to refer to Mandarin Chinese. Knowing the code of the language you are working on is very important, and necessary for almost any kind of editing on Wiktionary.
:* On Wiktionary, categories are often added to pages by the templates used on that page, so there is no need to put them directly on the page. In particular, [[Wiktionary:Headword-line templates|headword-line templates]] and context templates are most commonly used to add entries to the appropriate categories.

While this Wiktionary is known as the English Wiktionary, it is still a matter of fundamental policy that this dictionary includes "all words in all languages".  To the broad extent that this is applicable it necessitates that some articles will need to reflect the structure and peculiatities of the language in question at the moment. The pages listed in the category [[:Category:Wiktionary:Language considerations]] deal with how to manage entries in a specific language, or instances of words in that language on other pages.

There are some general issues that affect a wide range of languages. These include

#* '''1872''', Lewis Carroll, ''[[s:Through The Looking Glass (And What Alice Found There)|Through The Looking Glass]]'' ([[s:Through the Looking Glass (And What Alice Found There)/Chapter VI|Chapter VI. Humpty Dumpty]]), the first usage in this sense:
#*: Well, “[[slithy]]” means “[[lithe]] and [[slimy]].” “Lithe” is the same as “active”. You see it’s like a '''[[portmanteau]]'''–there are two meanings packed up into one word.

#* '''2002''', Nick Bradshaw, ''One day in September'' in ''Time Out'' (December 11, 2002) Page 71:
#*: We're so bombarded with images, it's a struggle to preserve our imaginations.' In response, he's turned to cinema, commissioning 11 film-makers to contribute to a '''portmanteau''' film, entitled '11'09"01' and composed of short films each running 11 minutes, nine seconds and one frame.

@ Wiktionary:Public domain sources
$ {{shortcut|WT:PDS}}
Using public domain works as a base for Wiktionary: Several public domain works can be used for sourcing texts into Wiktionary. Webster's dictionary from 1913 is available in plain text online, convenient for copying and pasting. The Century Dictionary 1911 is available as DJVU online, and has to be manually retyped. Some volumes of Oxford English Dictionary are available as DJVU and have to be manually retyped. There are some other sources in public domain, such as 1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue available in plain text.

==Webster 1913==

See also [[Wiktionary:Webster's Dictionary, 1913]]. Many definitions from ''Webster’s New International Dictionary of the English Language'', 1913, have been imported into Wiktionary. There is the template {{temp|webster 1913}} and the category [[:Category:Webster 1913]]. The dictionary has etymologies, definitions, and synonyms.

Available online for seach at [http://humanities.uchicago.edu/forms_unrest/webster.form.html ARTFL Project]; available as one huge plain text file from [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29765 Project Gutenberg #29675].

For a past discussion from 2002 and 2003, see the talk page.

==Century 1911==

''The Century Dictionary'', 1911 is a public domain dictionary available as DJVU from [http://www.global-language.com/CENTURY/ www.global-language.com]. It can be read with a DJVU plugin, but also without it in a JPEG version. It is in public domain per its being  published in the United States pre-1923.

==Oxford English Dictionary==

The first fascicle of the Oxford English Dictionary was published in 1884, and it was published in fascicles until completion in 1928. Oxford English Dictionary is a great source of word history.

Some scanned fascicles of Oxford English Dictionary under the title ''A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles'' by James A. H.

He is scanning those fascicles published in the US before 1923, maybe because in the UK the copyright is [http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=16644 extended to author's life + 70 years]. There seem to be no plain text files converted using OCR.

The volume 1 of OED, 1884, is also avaliable at Fractionary, starting at [http://fraktionary.com/index.php/OED:1_1 OED:1_1], and ending at [http://fraktionary.com/index.php/OED:1_1240 OED:1_1240].

====Usage notes====
* {{sense|distinct unit of language}} In English and other space-delimited languages, it is customary to treat "word" as referring to any sequence of characters delimited by spaces. However, this is not applicable to languages such as [[Chinese]] and [[Japanese]], which are normally written without spaces, or to languages such as [[Vietnamese]], which are written with a space between each [[syllable]].

{{wikipedia|word (computing)}}
* {{sense|computing}} The size (length) of a word, while being fixed in a particular machine or processor family design, can be different in different designs, for many reasons. See [[Wikipedia:Word_(computing)]] for a full [[explanation]].

====Synonyms====

===Etymology 1===
From {{etyl|enm}}, from {{etyl|ang}} {{term|pund||a pound, weight|lang=ang}}, from {{etyl|gem-pro|en}} {{recons|pundan||pound, weight|lang=gem-pro}}, an early borrowing from {{etyl|la}} {{term|pondo|pondō|lang=la|by weight}}, ablative form of {{term|pondus|lang=la||weight}}, from {{etyl|ine-pro|en}} {{recons|pend-|lang=ine-pro}}, {{recons|spend-||to pull, stretch|lang=ine-pro}}. Cognate with Dutch {{term|pond|lang=nl}}, German {{term|Pfund|lang=de}}, Swedish {{term|pund|lang=sv}}.

====Noun====
{{en-noun}} (sometimes '''pound''' after numerals)

# Short for [[pound-force]], a unit of force/weight.
# A [[unit]] of [[mass]] equal to 16 [[avoirdupois]] ounces (= 453.592 37 g). Today this value is the most common meaning of "pound" as a unit of weight.
#* '''28 July 2010''', Rachel Williams in The Guardian, ''Mothers who lose weight before further pregnancy 'reduce risks'''[http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/28/mothers-lose-weight-reduce-risks?INTCMP=SRCH]
#*: Research shows that retaining even one or two '''pounds''' after giving birth can make problems more likely in a subsequent pregnancy, experts said, with women who have several children facing a "slippery slope" if they continue to gain weight each time.
# A unit of [[mass]] equal to 12 [[troy weight|troy ounce]]s (≈ 373.242 g). Today, this is a common unit of weight when measuring precious metals, and is little used elsewhere.
# {{US}} The symbol {{unsupported|#}} ([[octothorpe]], [[hash]]) <!--isn't this "pound sign" rather than "pound"?-->
# The unit of currency used in the United Kingdom and its [[dependency|dependencies]]. It is divided into 100 [[pence]].
#* '''November 11 2012''', Carole Cadwalladr in the Observer, ''Do online courses spell the end for the traditional university?''[http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/nov/11/online-free-learning-end-of-university?INTCMP=SRCH]
#*: For students in developing countries who can't get it any other way, or for students in the first world, who can but may choose not to. Pay thousands of pounds a year for your education? Or get it free online?
#* '''1860''', {{w|George Eliot}}, ''The Mill on the Floss'', Book 5, Chapter 6
#*: "Only a hundred and ninety-three '''pound'''," said Mr. Tulliver. "You've brought less o' late; but young fellows like to have their own way with their money. Though I didn't do as I liked before I was of age." He spoke with rather timid discontent.
# Any of various units of [[currency]] used in Cyprus, Egypt, Lebanon, and formerly in the Republic of Ireland and Israel.
#* {{RQ:Joyce Ulysses}} Episode 4
#*: He glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his water flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and received payment of three '''pounds''', thirteen and six.
# Any of various units of [[currency]] formerly used in the [[United States]].
#: ''the Rhode Island '''pound'''; the New Hampshire '''pound'''''
# {{plural of|pound|nodot=1}} (unit of currency)
#* {{quote-book|year=2010|author=Steven Field|title=Dusty's Fort|publisher=|url=|isbn=1445292416|page=33|passage=He knocked out cans of warm cola at two '''pound''' fifty a time.}}

=====Usage notes=====
* Internationally, the "pound" has most commonly referred to the UK pound, £, (pound sterling). The other currencies were usually distinguished in some way, e.g., the "Irish pound" or the "punt".
* In the vicinity of each other country calling its currency the pound among English speakers the local currency would be the "pound", with all others distinguished, e.g., the "British pound", the "Egyptian pound" etc.
* The general plural of "pound" has usually been "pounds" (at least since Chaucer), but the continuing use of the Old English genitive or neuter "pound" as the plural after numerals (for both currency and weight) is common in some regions.  It can be considered correct, or colloquial, depending on region.

== The pronunciation of "Wiktionary" in the logo ==

'''Q:''' Is the pronunciation of “Wiktionary” in the logo correct?  Should there not be an extra syllable, a long ‘i’ at the end, or a different stress pattern?

:'''A:''' The pronunciation is the [[RP|received pronunciation]] (RP) of “Wiktionary”, based on the RP of “dictionary” found in British dictionaries.  Other pronunciations of “dictionary” are used in the United Kingdom, and this particular pronunciation is not really heard outside the United Kingdom (and is somewhat dated even there).  However, this is the pronunciation that was used to create the logo, and it would be difficult to change it without creating a new logo.

== Starting out ==
'''Q:''' How do I add a new word?

:'''A:''' You can find out at [[Help:Starting a new page]].

'''Q:''' Where is the alphabetical listing?

:'''A:''' Try using the search feature instead. [[Special:Allpages]] lists all of the pages in Wiktionary, including the utility pages in the Wiktionary: namespace.  [[Index:English]] gives an alphabetic listing of English entries in Wiktionary, and pages in [[:Category:Language indexes]] do the same for other languages.

'''Q:''' I've found a common word that is missing from Wiktionary, and thought of adding a seed entry. But it seems like you want fully grown entries or nothing! I'm not a lexicologist. I'm just someone who feels he can contribute some simple dictionary definitions. I don't know anything about etymology, translations or whatever! In Wikipedia a lot of people are quite happy to come along and copy-edit, wikify etc. Does that apply here?

:'''A:''' Yes!  Wiktionary is still much smaller than Wikipedia, but the wiki philosophy is just as strong.  If a word does not exist on Wiktionary add it.  If you know nothing about etymology that's fine; your humblest contribution is still better than nothing.  Someone else can add the etymology later. The minimum you need to include is the language of the word, its [[part of speech]], and its meaning.

:However, if you are contributing a translation, it is important to know to which meaning of the word the translation applies. 

'''Q:''' I've already done some work without signing up, but now I would like to create a username to have all my work shown as my own. How can I create a new username?

:'''A:''' Just click on the '''Create an account or log in''' link on the top right of every Wiktionary page or [[Special:Userlogin]].

== Pronunciation ==
'''Q:''' Is there a table indicating which IPA symbols make certain sounds?

:'''A.''' Near the top of a page, there should be a pronunciation section, like so:
::{{IPA|/ˈwɪkʃənrɪ/}}, {{IPA|/ˈwɪkʃəˌnɛri/}}
: Just follow the links.

'''Q:''' How do we type those symbols?

:'''A:''' When you are in the edit page you will see below the save buttons a box with many accented letters and a pull-down menu that reads "Latin/Roman".  Select "IPA" or "enPR" from the pull-down menu, depending on the pronunciation scheme you want.  (There isn't an option for SAMPA as all SAMPA characters can be typed on an ordinary keyboard.)  Position the text cursor where you want the symbol to be inserted, then click on the desired character.

'''Q:''' The IPA symbols are showing up as blocks in Internet Explorer, is there a way to fix this?

:'''A.''' The easiest way for Windows/Internet Explorer users is to make sure the font "Arial Unicode MS" is installed. Then, in Internet Explorer go to Tools/Internet Options.../General tab.  Select the "Fonts..." button at the bottom.  Make sure the "Language script" displays "Latin based", then set the "Web Page Font" to "Arial Unicode MS".  Click OK twice to exit.

'''Q:''' I've tried the above, and it still doesn't work. Any other ideas? 

:'''A:''' Works fine when setting Skin to Classic, Nostalgica or MySkin on your Preferences side, but not with Skins Cologne Blue, MonoBook. Would be nice if somebody could fix this.  Alternatively, try a different browser, such as Firefox, which displays these characters correctly.

== Article format ==
'''Q:''' How do we format articles? Is there a standard format we should use?

:'''A:''' Guidelines for this can be seen at [[Wiktionary:Entry layout explained]].  The concepts on that page have varying levels of acceptability, and continue to evolve as new techniques are developed to deal with a wide array of challenges relating to different languages.

'''Q:''' Some people link to other words as they type a definition. Since every English word would eventually be listed on the Wiktionary, maybe someone could add a code (which perhaps could be turned off) that made [[every]] [[word]] [[link]] [[to]] [[its]] [[corresponding]] [[entry]].

:'''A:''' When an article is loaded the software checks each linking word to see if the article for the word exists, and it is marked in blue if it exists, red if it does not.  It only takes a fraction of a second to check each word, but if more words are checked this time is cumulative. If '''every''' word is checked, it could cause serious slowdowns.  This already happens in link-rich articles.  How often does one really need a link to "[[the]]"?
: Also, it's often clearer to link a compound word, or the root of a word, depending on the meaning.

== Real words ==
'''Q:''' That's not a real word, is it?

:'''A:''' In general, Wiktionary does not concern itself with metaphysical abstractions like "realness".  We instead use a set of objective criteria for inclusion ([[WT:CFI]]), and a word may meet those requirements in a number of ways, such as through its use in multiple publications over an extended period of time.

== Writing definitions ==
'''Q:''' How should we go about writing definitions?

:'''A:''' In some respects writing a definition is an art.  Begin by finding examples where the word is used, and distill a definition that would be accurate for '''all''' of the examples.  It may very well be that a word can have more than one definition.  You can then add the quotations as examples. See also [[Help:Writing definitions]] & [http://www.wikihow.com/Write-a-Dictionary-Definition How to Write a Dictionary Definition].

'''Q:''' How shouldn't we go about writing definitions?

:'''A:''' One should not simply copy without crediting the definitions from other dictionaries and glossaries.

'''Q:''' Can I use what I find in other dictionaries and glossaries? How? How much?

:'''A:''' Yes and no! Wiktionary should represent the language as it is used in practice, and that is best done through evidence of usage.  Not all dictionaries provide this kind of evidence and may only reflect usages current at the time that the dictionary was published.  The 1913 edition of Webster's Dictionary is a popular freely available source, but it must be supplemented to show how some words have changed since 1913.

:There are copyright issues associated with more recent dictionaries.  Also, specialized glossaries and other books may have the '''only''' accurate definition of a technical term, but they may be protected by copyright.  [[fair use|Fair use]] (or fair dealing) is important here, and can apply as long as we don't use too much from one source.  Whenever we use a source in that way, it must be credited.  The legal issues about this are very complex, and it is wise to find other ways of expressing yourself so that fair use will not need to be a factor.

== Limiting and/or ordering definitions ==

'''Q:''' To avoid bias, should we sometimes limit or order the definitions so as to avoid giving the impression that rare or difficult uses of a word are more common than they are?

:'''A:''' Yes, in theory, the oldest uses of a word should be listed first, but in the absence of historical data this is difficult to do.  Furthermore, definitions are sometimes related, and should be close to each other in such circumstances.  Determining which usage is most common or popular requires expressing a Point of View, and should be avoided.  Links to Wikipedia or references to the Oxford English Dictionary are better ways to ensure that the definitions are complete.

'''Q:''' Is there a subset of the wiktionary that would include only meanings that are known to be necessary for learning English as a second language, or for learning common English idioms?

:'''A:''' There is provision for this idea. If you have the time, you could consider participating in the separate project at [[:Simple:Main Page]] that aims to do just that!  This kind of simplification is not a simple undertaking, and it has not attracted a lot of interest.  See also  [http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_English_Dictionary  Simple English Dictionary] on the Simple English Wikipedia.

== Copyright infringement==

'''Q:''' I saw some copyrighted material in a certain article, submitted by user XYZ. What should I do?

:'''A:''' In a publication like ours it is never easy to determine when a copyright infringement has taken place.  Fair use ''(see below)'' is not an infringement.  If you suspect that an article contains copyrighted material, use the following steps:
:# Don't panic, and do your homework.
:# On the talk page for the article show why you think it is a copyright violation.  In particular show exactly where you think the text in question was originally published.  
:# As a matter of courtesy, if the material was placed by a registered user, politely let him know about this on his talk page.
:# Add <nowiki>{{rfc}}</nowiki> to the article and make a note at [[WT:RFC]].  There is no need to immediately remove the suspected material.  

'''Q:''' What is copyright?

:'''A:''' Copyright is a person's exclusive economic right to use and exploit his own creative and artistic productions.  Its duration depends primarily on the laws of the country in which that person lives.  It may be accompanied by moral rights such as the right to be properly credited for one's works.  A work whose copyright has expired is said to be in the public domain.

'''Q:''' What is fair use?

:'''A:''' In simple terms, "[[fair use]]" (also known as "fair dealing" or "fair practice") is the allowable quotation of the copyrighted works of others.  The concept is not relevant to works that are already in the public domain. Any such quotation '''must''' be properly credited.  Whether any particular quotation constitutes fair use can often be a very difficult matter to resolve.  In most cases, quoting a single definition or a brief illustrative passage from any author's work will fall within the definition of fair use.

== Namespaces ==

'''Q:''' Occasionally in a discussion I see a reference to a "namespace".  What is that?

:'''A:''' A namespace is a group of pages designed to fulfill a special purpose.      Namespaces are denoted by a prefix followed by a colon, as [[Talk:color]].  The one exception to that is the "article" namespace, which contains the substantive articles for the Wiktionary; it has no prefix.  See [[Help:Namespace]] for more information.  Articles in a namespace are also sorted and searched separately from those in other namespaces.  Articles in different namespaces may have identical names after the prefix.

'''Q:''' Where can I see a list of active namespaces?

:'''A:''' See [[Wiktionary:Namespace]] or [[Special:Allpages]].  Currently, they are "(articles)", "Talk", "User", "User talk", "Wiktionary", "Wiktionary talk", "Image", "Image talk", "MediaWiki", "MediaWiki talk", "Template", "Template talk", "Help", "Help talk", "Category", "Category talk", "Appendix", "Appendix talk", "Index", "Index talk", "Wikisaurus", "Wikisaurus talk", "Concordance", "Concordance talk", "Rhymes", "Rhymes talk", "Transwiki", "Transwiki talk", "Citations", "Citations talk".

'''Q:''' Is it possible to restrict a search to a given namespace?

:'''A:''' Yes, [[Special:Allpages]] allows you to search individual namespaces.

== Wiktionary in your language ==

'''Q:''' What should I do if I want to start a Wiktionary in my own language?

:'''A:''' You should go to the [[m:requests for new languages|requests for new languages]] page on Meta.

== Referencing Wiktionaries from Other Wikipedias ==

'''Q:''' What is Transwiki?

:'''A:''' Transwiki is a way of moving articles from one wiki to another (in the case of Wiktionary, especially from Wikipedia to Wiktionary).  It essentially applies to articles that have been written in the wrong project.  By putting the article in the namespace "Transwiki:" the transferor can park it there without concern about our format or whether we will even accept it. 

'''Q:''' Are <nowiki>[[wiktionary:Dog]]</nowiki> and <nowiki>[[wiktionary:eo:Konduto]]</nowiki> suitable references from other Wikipedias to Wiktionaries?

:'''A:''' From a Wikipedia, <nowiki>[[wiktionary:Dog]] or the shorter [[wikt:Dog]]</nowiki> should link to the Wiktionary in the same language.

:'''A:''' From Wiktionary, a link beginning with the word ''Wiktionary'' is treated as a link to the page in the ''Wiktionary namespace'' with the title <nowiki>[[wiktionary:dog]]</nowiki>. Upper or lower case of the first letter of the article title may give different results in this Wiktionary - (see [[m:Help:Page_name#Case-sensitivity_of_the_first_character|here]] for the status of this on other wiktionaries). In the same way, here the link <nowiki> [[wikipedia:Dog]] </nowiki> will link to wikipedia.

== What is a template? ==

'''Q:''' What is a Wiktionary template?

:'''A:''' The word '''template''' in Wiktionary jargon means an entry in the Template: namespace which substitutes the content of the template whenever it is addressed in an article.

'''Q:''' How does it work?

:'''A:''' Someone devises a template such as [[template:Wikipedia]].  Then, others use it by adding the text <nowiki>{{Wikipedia}}</nowiki> into their articles.  When anyone displays that article, the text from [[template:Wikipedia]] is ''included in that page''.  In this example the template produces a box that includes a link to the article with the same name in Wikipedia,

'''Q:''' Where can I find a list of these templates?

:'''A:''' See [[Wiktionary:Index to templates]].

== Examples ==

'''Q:''' Should I add examples to each definition? 

:'''A:''' Examples are good, but [[Wiktionary:Quotations|quotations]] are much better.  A well-chosen quotation can do everything that an example can, and additionally show evidence 
:* of the age of a word,
:* that the meaning given reflects actual use, and
:* that the word isn't just made up for Wiktionary.

== Log in ==
'''Q:''' If I have an account with Wikipedia, do I still have to create a new account with Wiktionary?

:'''A:''' No, provided you have accepted the Single log-in, you can keep the same username throughout all Wikimedia projects.

== What are interwiki links? ==

'''Q''': What are interwiki links?

:'''A''': Interwiki links in Wiktionary are links from one language Wiktionary to another.  For example, the French Wiktionary has the word [[:fr:chat|chat]] which corresponds to the English Wiktionary's entry under the title [[chat#French|chat]].  One is written in French (for the French Wiktionary) the other in English (for the English Wiktionary.)  Interwiki links link these two articles to each other (note: not their translations.)

'''Q''': Where do interwiki links belong/what is the correct interwiki syntax?

:'''A''': Interwiki links appear in one of two places: either at the very end of the article, or embedded in a translation table.  Interwiki links at the end of the article follow "normal" interwiki syntax: <tt><nowiki>[[</nowiki></tt> followed by the (usually two-digit) country code, then a colon, then this same article name (identical matches ONLY!) followed by <tt><nowiki>]]</nowiki></tt>.  For interwikis within translations, (say in the translation table of the English article [[cat]],) you would normally list first the ''English'' Wiktionary's wikified link; [[chat]], as <tt><nowiki>[[chat]]</nowiki></tt> to allow your readers to learn about the French word (by reading the English description of it) then the French version of the French word is linked as [[:fr:chat|chat]] by entering <tt><nowiki>[[:fr:chat|chat]]</nowiki></tt>.

'''Q''': This is too confusing, and it makes the article source look sloppy.  Can I just delete them?

:'''A''': '''No.'''  If you don't know why it is there, don't remove it.

'''Q''': I still don't get it.  Why have interwiki links?  They don't make anything on the page change.

:'''A''': On the left-most column (if using the default monobook User preferences skin) below the "toolbox" is where the interwiki links appear.

== Wikifying ==

Q: What is wikifying/wikification?

:A: Putting two square brackets before and after a term will auto-generate a hypertext markup language link to that word's page, here on Wiktionary.  Thus, entering <nowiki> [[link]] </nowiki> will give [[link]].

Q: [[why|Why]] [[don't]] [[we]] [[wikify]] [[every]] [[word]]?  [[That]] [[would]] [[be]] [[so]] [[cool]]!

:A: We don't for several reasons:
:* Logical continuity.  The wikilinks are meant to help clarify aspects of a meaning; it's good to have the important words stand out. 
:* Server performance.  The computers must check every word that's linked like that.  It's no big deal on a short article, but it really slows down the downloading of longer articles.

Q: Fine then.  Hey [[look-]] a red link!  Should I dewikify it?

:A: Maybe, but usually, '''no!'''  Red links let you know where there is work yet to be done.  They also help new users understand that they can help out here too.

Q: Any other guidelines on what to wikify?

:A: The following are but a few.
:*On the inflection line, (the line following the part-of-speech header) you should wikify '''all''' component words of idioms and phrases.  
:*You should wikify all translated words.
:*You should wikify all but the "top 40" language names in translation sections.  If the country name matches the language name, it probably is a "top 40" common language.
:*You should wikify the expansion of abbreviations.  Usually the main article should go with the short form's ''expansion entry'', not the abbreviation itself.
:*All foreign language words in the etymology section should be wikified.
:*All foreign languages in the etymology section should be wikified.
:*All inflections of a word should be wikified (plurals, comparatives, superlatives, third person, participles and past tenses.)
:*None of the words in example sentences or quotations should be wikified.  The headword of the entry should be bolded, within example sentences and quotations.

Q: Okay then, where are the other guidelines and the rules ?

== English header ==

Q: I see a bunch of articles that have no language specified, but they are clearly written for English terms.  That makes sense.  Should I remove ==English== wherever I see it then?

A: No.  It is very much a required heading.

The ==English== header is not assumed.  It cannot be, since we aim to include "all words."  Also, it reminds people that they can enter other languages.

:Some more reasons why "==English==" is required:
:# Introduces newcomers to wiki* syntax
:# Indicates (by implication) to newcomers that a single entry can have more than one language
:# Indicates ''which'' parts are English
:# It reminds new contributors that they can enter words and definitions of other languages.
:# The absence of the English heading is an indication that the person entering it is new, and the article probably needs cleanup.
<!--:# The use of 1<sup>st</sup> level English headings implies a vandal, therefore candidate for deletion.

I COMMENTED OUT THIS BIT, AS IT IS VERY MISLEADING. User:Keene - 3 Jan 2006-->
:# The presence of the English heading makes it readily apparent how another language definition can be added to a page.
:# The presence of the English heading makes parsing articles by external tools easier.  (The point of Wiktionary is to provide electronic access to everyone, everywhere, provided they extend the same courtesy to their derived works.  There is nothing to say that we should arbitrarily make it more difficult for programs to interpret.)
:#The presence of the English heading makes parsing articles by internal "bots" easier/possible.

== Downloading Wiktionary ==

Q: Is it possible to download Wiktionary?

A: Yes.  http://download.wikimedia.org/enwiktionary/ should have the latest copy of the main namespace.  The cleanest navigation page is http://download.wikimedia.org/. Just download a *-articles.xml.bz2 file and some software to read it ([http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_dumps#Wikipedia_Dump_Reader for *nix], [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_dumps#BzReader_.28Windows_offline_reader.29 for Windows]).

A: If you just want definitions, you can try http://toolserver.org/~enwikt/definitions/.

Q: Can I use data from Wiktionary in my program?

A: As long as you meet the conditions of the [[w:GFDL|GNU Free Documentation License]], certainly.

== How do I batch upload? ==

Q: Hi, I have a bunch of words in ''language'' that I can upload, already containing the word, grammatical tags and basic English translation.  However, how would I do a batch upload, since I don't have the kind of time to enter each one separately?

A: The robot code in question is from the [[meta:Using the python wikipediabot|Using the python wikipediabot]]'s <tt>pagefromfile.py</tt>.

Example: dict.txt

<pre>
'''Mangaung'''
{{-start-}}
==Sesotho==

===Proper noun===
'''Mangaung'''

# [[Bloemfontein]]
{{-stop-}}
'''kgòtsò'''
{{-start-}}
==Sesotho==

===Noun===
'''kgòtsò'''

# [[peace]]
{{-stop-}}
</pre>

Remember to learn the Wiktionary format of entries before starting.  It will correctly run "throttled" by default.  Start with ten entries.  When you get ten to load correctly, try running one hundred ''then stop'' and check the results; make sure you haven't been blocked for flooding and none of your entries have been edited already.  If any have been edited, you don't have the format correct and need to fix the problem before testing again.

Request 'bot status in the [[WT:BP|Beer parlour]] if you get complaints.  If entries are not marked minor by default, go to [[Special:Preferences]], [Editing] and check off "Mark all edits minor by default".

Q: What if someone keeps posting messages on my talk page, saying I'm uploading them wrong?

A: Stop what you are doing.  Ask for help on [[WT:ID|Wiktionary's information desk]].

== How do I link to Wikipedia? ==

{{wikipedia|Wikipedia:How to edit a page#Links and URLs}}
In general, we should have terms defined locally here.  But in a definition, if you need to refer to the corresponding Wikipedia entry there are three common methods:  
*When referencing Wikipedia ''outside'' of a definition, you can simply use the inter-project prefix "<tt>w:</tt>", e.g. <tt><nowiki>[[w:WP:FAQ|]]</nowiki><tt> = [[w:WP:FAQ|WP:FAQ]].  Other useful interproject links to know are "<tt>s:</tt>" for linking to [[s:|Wikisource]] documents used for quotations, and of course you may use "<tt>wikt:</tt>" to link to Wiktionary from other sister projects.  Note that interproject links do not work in redirects.  
* When Wikipedia has one or more articles about a word or phrase, you can add {{temp|pedialite}} in a "See also" section at the end of the entry, just before the categories and interwiki links:
<pre>
===See also===
*{{pedialite}}
</pre>
:This produces:
::*{{pedialite|Help:FAQ}}
:See [[Template talk:pedialite]] for more information.
* You can also add the template {{temp|wikipedia}} at the top of the language section, which adds a "fancy" sister project link box.

== Why do you block new editors so readily? ==
As said at the top of [[Help:Interacting with humans]], "Actions that appear destructive are either a result of someone not caring, not understanding, or not concentrating. Those who don't care should be blocked lest they cause damage, those who don't understand should be educated, and accidental damage should be undone." Allowing someone who doesn't care about Wiktionary to edit it is a waste of everyone's time, as is giving warnings to people who will not take them on board.

==Flexibility==
While the information below may represent some kind of “standard” form, it is not a set of rigid rules.  You may experiment with deviations, but other editors may find those deviations unacceptable, and revert those changes.  They have just as much right to do that as you have to make them.  Be ready to discuss those changes.  If you want your way accepted, you have to make the case for that.  Unless there is a good reason for deviating, the standard should be presumed correct.  Refusing to discuss, or engaging in edit wars may also affect your credibility in other unrelated areas.

==Basics==
===Entry name===
The name of the entry is that of the word or phrase that you are defining. For languages with two cases of script, the entry name will usually begin with a lowercase letter. Exceptions include proper nouns, German nouns, and many abbreviations.

===The essentials===
# '''Language''' lets you know the language of the word in question. It is almost always in a level two heading (See [[Help:How to edit a page|Wiktionary:How to edit a page]] for some basic terminology we use). In most cases the language header contains a language in its traditional meaning. Priority is given to <nowiki>==Translingual==</nowiki>; this heading includes terms that remain the same in all languages. The symbols for the chemical elements and the abbreviations for international units of measurement are but two examples of translingual terms. English comes next because this is the English Wiktionary. After that come the other languages in alphabetical order.
# '''Part of speech''' may be a misnomer, but it seemed to make sense when it was first chosen. Most part-of-speech headings represent the lexical function of the term, such as ''Noun'', ''Verb'', ''Adjective'', or ''Interjection''. Others, such as ''Symbol'', ''Suffix'', ''Initialism'', ''Phrase'', or ''Proverb'', classify the various terms in Wiktionary. Each entry has one or more part of speech sections, where the definitions themselves are found. The sections are most frequently level three, but may have a lower level for terms that have multiple etymologies or pronunciations.<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2012-04/Editing the "part of speech" paragraph in ELE]]</ref>
# '''References''' are becoming more important as we strive to improve the reliability of Wiktionary.  While we may be lax in demanding references for words that are easily found in most paper dictionaries, references for more obscure words are essential.  References may be added in a separate header of adequately chosen level or added directly to specific senses.

===A very simple example===
This is a simple entry for the word '''bed''', and shows the most fundamental elements of an entry: 
# a word’s language (as a level 2 heading),
# its part of speech or “type” (as a level 3 heading),
# the [[inflection]] word itself (using the correct Part of Speech template or the word in bold letters),
# a definition (preceded by “'''#'''”, which causes automatic numbering),
# links in the definition for key words,
# “References” (as a level 3 heading), and 	 
# a verifiable place where you found the word

This example can be copied and used to start an entry or section of an entry.
<pre>
==English==

===Noun===
{{en-noun}}

# A piece of [[furniture]] to [[sleep]] on.

===References===  	 
* ''The Oxford Paperback Dictionary'' 	 
</pre>

===Variations for languages other than English===
Entries for terms in other languages should follow the standard format as closely as possible regardless of the language of the word. However, a translation into English should normally be given instead of a definition, including a gloss to indicate which meaning of the English translation is intended. Also, the translations section should be omitted.

Some languages do have characteristics that require variation from the standard format.  For links to these variations see [[Wiktionary:Language considerations]].

==Additional headings==
There are additional headings which you should include if possible, but if you don’t have the necessary expertise, resources or time, you have no obligation to add them, with the possible exception of “References”.  The list below is not an exclusive list; other headings may be essential in some circumstances.  An order for these headings is recommended, but variations in that order are also allowable.

A typical entry that uses many of these additional headings could be formatted thus:<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/2008-12/Amending ELE example entry]]</ref><ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2010-07/Alternative forms header]]</ref>

A key principle in ordering the headings and indentation levels is nesting.  The order shown above accomplishes this most of the time.  A heading placed at one level includes everything that follows until an equivalent level is encountered.  If a word can be a noun and a verb, everything that derives from its being the first chosen part of speech should be put before the second one is started.  Nesting is a key principle to the organization of Wiktionary, but the concept suffers from being difficult to describe with verbal economy.  If you have problems with this, examine existing entries, or ask questions of a more senior person.

===Headings before the definitions===
In general, headings in this group do not depend on the meaning of the word.  They give an environment that leads up to the word and its relation to other words, and allow us to distinguish it from others that may be similar in some respects.

====Etymology====
:''Main article: [[Wiktionary:Etymology]]''

The first header below the language heading is usually the level 3 “Etymology” header. The etymology is given right below the header without indentation.  Etymology essentially shows where the word comes from.  This may show the forms in other languages that underlie the word.  For many modern words it may show who coined the word.  If a word is derived from another in the same language by a regular rule, such as formation of an English adverb by adding “ly”, it is not necessary to repeat the complete details of the word’s origin on the page for the derived word.<ref name=2010-08/>

Sometimes two [[word]]s with different etymologies belong in the same entry because they are spelled the same (they are homographs). In such a case there will be more than one “Etymology” header, which we number. Hence for a word like ''[[lead]]'' the basic header skeleton looks like this:

<pre>
===Etymology 1===
====Pronunciation====
====Noun====
===Etymology 2===
====Pronunciation====
====Noun====
====Verb====
</pre>

Note that in the case of multiple etymologies, all subordinate headers need to have their levels increased by 1 in order to comply with the fundamental concept of showing dependence through nesting.

:''The vote “[[Wiktionary:Votes/2007-10/style for mentioned terms|2007-10/style for mentioned terms]]” is relevant to this section, without specifying text to be amended in this document, so please see it for details.''

====Pronunciation====
:''Main article: [[Wiktionary:Pronunciation]]''

A typical pronunciation section may look like the following example based on the word ''[[portmanteau]]'':

<pre>
* {{a|UK}} {{IPA|/pɔːtˈmantəʊ/}}, {{SAMPA|/pO:t"m{nt@U/}}
* {{a|US}} {{SAMPA|/pOrt"m{ntoU/}}
* {{audio|en-us-portmanteau.ogg|Audio (US)}}
</pre>

The region or accent [{{a|UK}}, {{a|US}}, {{a|Australia}}, ''et al.''] is first if there is regional variation, followed by the pronunciation system (such as SAMPA or IPA), a colon, then the pronunciation.  (See [[Wiktionary:Pronunciation|Wiktionary:Pronunciation key]] for an outline of these two systems.)  The phonetic transcriptions are normally placed between diagonal strokes.  While there is a natural bias in favour of established systems of pronunciation, it is not wrong to use an arbitrary representation if that’s all you know and there is an important point to be made.  For the word {{term|reject}}, one could have /RE-ject/ and /re-JECT/ to make the important distinction between the pronunciations of the noun and verb forms.  It may not be standard, but neither is it wrong.  Whenever possible, however, such ''ad hoc'' pronunciations should be replaced with one in an unambiguous system, such as [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]].

Ideally, every entry should have a pronunciation section, and perhaps a sound sample to accompany it.  However, pronunciations vary widely between dialects, and non-linguists often have trouble writing down pronunciations properly. 

For audio pronunciations, upload the Ogg file to [[:commons:Main Page|Commons]] and link here using [[Template:audio|Template:audio]].

:''The votes “[[Wiktionary:Votes/2007-02/Renaming AHD|2007-02/Renaming AHD]]” and “[[Wiktionary:Votes/2007-02/Renaming AHD (run-off)|2007-02/Renaming AHD (run-off)]]” are relevant to this section, without specifying text to be amended in this document, so please see them for details.''

:''The vote “[[Wiktionary:Votes/2008-01/IPA for English r|2008-01/IPA for English r]]” is relevant to this section, without specifying text to be amended in this document, so please see it for details.''

=====Homophones=====
List any [[homophone]]s of the word in alphabetical order, wikifying each one.  For example, the Pronunciation section of the English word {{term|right}} contains the line

<pre>
* <nowiki>{{homophones|rite|wright|write|lang=en}}</nowiki>
</pre>

which results in

* Homophones: [[rite]], [[wright]], [[write]]

which are the English words that sound identical to {{term|right}}.

If a word is a homophone in a particular dialect, it may be added provided the dialect is referred to (for example, {{term|rider}} is a homophone of {{term|writer}}<ref name=2010-08/> in accents with [[flapping]], and {{term|beater}} is a homophone of {{term|beta}} in [[non-rhotic]] accents).  Examples (for {{term|beater}} and {{term|right}}, respectively):

* Homophones: [[beta]] {{i|in [[non-rhotic]] accents}}
* Homophones: [[rite]], [[wright]], [[write]], [[ride]] {{i|in accents with [[flapping]]}}

The following must not be added to the homophones section:

* Words that are “nearly” homophones or rhymes (for example, for {{term|right}}, the words {{term|white}} or {{term|light}});
* Words that are homophones if they are mispronounced in some way (eg, for {{term|miss}}, the word {{term|myth}} when pronounced with a lisp);
* Foreign words.  These are unlikely to be true homophones (eg, Italian {{term|tipi||types}} is ''not'' a homophone of English {{term|tepee}}; the sounds of the vowels and consonants are similar but different).

(Note that the term used here is {{term|homophone}}; the term {{term|homonym}} used by some is ambiguous as it can mean either “homophone” or “[[homograph]]”.)

=====Rhymes=====
Add a link to the page in the “Rhymes” namespace that lists the rhymes for the word.  So, for example, on the entry for {{term|hat}}, add the line

<pre>
* {{rhymes|æt}}
</pre>

to the code. This displays as

* {{rhymes|æt}}

To see the usage instructions for {{temp|rhymes}}, see [[Template:rhymes/doc]].<ref name=2010-08/>

Do not list the rhymes themselves in the main namespace.<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/2012-01/Modify WT:ELE rhymes section]]</ref>

===The entry core===
====The part of speech or other descriptor====
{{main|Wiktionary:Entry layout explained/POS headers}}
This is usually a level-3 header but may be a higher-level header when multiple etymologies or pronunciations are a factor. This header most often shows the part of speech, but is not restricted to “parts of speech” in the traditional sense. Many other descriptors like “Proper noun”, “Idiom”, “Abbreviation”, “Symbol”, “Prefix”, etc.

:''The vote “[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2010-01/Allow "Prepositional phrase" as a POS header|pl-2010-01/Allow "Prepositional phrase" as a POS header]]” is relevant to this section, without specifying text to be amended in this document, so please see it for details.''

====Headword line====
We give a word’s inflections without indentation in the line below the “Part of speech” header. There is no separate header for this. For uninflected words it is enough to repeat the entry word in boldface. Further forms can be given in parentheses.
: For a noun this will simply be one of...
::'''word''' (''plural [[words]]'')
::'''word''' (''[[uncountable]]'')
::'''word''' (''[[plurale tantum]]'')
: ...depending whether the noun has a plural, is uncountable, or is itself a plural with no singular form, respectively.  For an adjective this will appear as one of...
::'''hard''' (''[[comparative]]'' '''[[harder]]''', ''[[superlative]]'' '''[[hardest]]''')
::'''growling''' (''not [[comparable]]'')
:...depending whether the adjective is comparable or not, respectively.  For a verb you may use
::'''to end''' (''third-person singular simple present'' '''[[ends]]''', ''present participle'' '''[[ending]]''', ''simple past'' '''[[ended]]''', ''past participle'' '''[[ended]]''')
Templates are available at [[Wiktionary:Headword-line templates]]<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/2010-12/Renaming categories for inflection or headword templates]]</ref> for those who prefer this technique.

====Definitions====
The definitions are the most fundamental piece of dictionary information but do not have their own header. They are simply added in one big block, line after line, each beginning with a number sign (<nowiki>#</nowiki>). Each definition may be treated as a sentence: beginning with a capital letter and ending with a full stop. The key terms of a definition should be wikified.

:''The vote “[[Wiktionary:Votes/2006-12/form-of style|2006-12/form-of style]]” is relevant to this section, without specifying text to be amended in this document, so please see it for details.''

:''The vote “[[Wiktionary:Votes/2010-08/Italicizing use-with-mention|2010-08/Italicizing use-with-mention]]” is relevant to this section, without specifying text to be amended in this document, so please see it for details.''

=====Abbreviations=====
:''See [[Wiktionary:Entry layout explained/POS headers]] for discussion of the appropriate part of speech for different types of abbreviation''

The “definitions” of entries that are abbreviations should be the expanded forms of the abbreviations. Where there is more than one expansion of the abbreviation, ideally these should be listed alphabetically to prevent the expanded forms being duplicated. The [[case]] used in the expanded form should be the usual one &mdash; do not capitalise words in the expanded form of an abbreviation that is made up of capital letters unless that is how the expanded form is usually written.

Where the expanded forms are entries that appear (or should appear) in Wiktionary, wikify them. Expanded forms that are encyclopedic entries should also be wikified and linked to the appropriate Wikipedia entry. When the expanded form does not merit an entry of its own, either in Wiktionary or Wikipedia material, wikify its component words and give a [[gloss]] (italicised, in parentheses) after the expansion explaining what the term means (see [[SNAFU]] for an example).

See [[PC]] for an example entry.

===== Context labels =====

A [[:Category:Context labels|context label]] identifies '''a definition which only applies in a restricted context'''.<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2009-03/Context labels in ELE v2]]</ref>  Such labels indicate, for example, that the following definition occurs in a limited geographic region or temporal period, or is used only by specialists in a particular field and not by the general population. Many context label templates also place an entry into a relevant category, but they must not be used merely for categorization (see [[#Category links|category links]], below).  

One or more  labels may be placed before the definition:

{| style="margin-bottom: 1em;"
|-
! style="text-align:left; font-weight:normal; padding-right:1.5em;" | wikitext
! style="text-align:left; font-weight:normal; padding-right:1.5em;" | result
|- style="vertical-align:top;"
| width=50% style="padding-right:1.5em; font-family:monospace;" |
<nowiki>#</nowiki> {{temp|informal}} <nowiki>An [[informant]] or [[snitch]].</nowiki>
| style="padding-right:1.5em;" | 
#  {{informal}} An [[informant]] or [[snitch]].
|}

====Example sentences====
<section begin="exampleSentences" />
Generally, every definition should be accompanied by a [[Wiktionary:Quotations|quotation]] illustrating the definition.<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/2007-07/Layout of example sentences]]</ref>  If no quotation can be found, it is strongly encouraged to create an example sentence.  Example sentences should:
:*be grammatically complete sentences, beginning with a capital letter and ending with a period, question mark, or exclamation point.
:*be placed immediately <em>after</em> the applicable numbered definition, and <em>before</em> any quotations associated with that specific definition.
:*be ''italicized'', with the defined term '''boldfaced'''.
:*be as brief as possible while still clarifying the sense of the term.  (In rare cases, examples consisting of two brief sentences may work best.)
:*be indented using the “<tt>#:</tt>” command placed at the start of the line.
:*for languages in non-Latin scripts, a transcription is to be given in the line below, with an additional level of indentation: “<tt>#::</tt>”.
:*for languages other than English, a translation is to be given in the line below (i.e. below the sentence or below the transcription), with an additional level of indentation: “<tt>#::</tt>”.
:* '''not''' contain wikilinks (the words should be easy enough to understand without additional lookup)

The goal of the example sentences is the following, which is to be kept in mind when making one up:
:# To place the term in a context in which it is likely to appear, addressing level of formality, dialect, etc.
:# To provide notable [[collocation]]s, particularly those that are not idiomatic.
:# To select scenarios in which the meaning of the example itself is clear.
:# To illustrate the meaning of the term to the extent that a definition is obtuse.
:# To exemplify varying grammatical frames that are well understood, especially those that may not be obvious, for instance relying on collocation with a preposition.<section end="exampleSentences" />
*See [[Wiktionary:Example sentences]] for more.

===Headings after the definitions===
These headings generally derive from knowing the meaning of the word.

In the main namespace, any line of text whose only purpose is linking to an external website (for example, a link to an encyclopedia, such as Wikipedia, or 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica), should be placed within an "External links" section, and never within a "See also" section.<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/2011-07/External links|2011-07/External links]]</ref>

====Order of headings====
*'''Usage notes'''<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2007-06/ELE level 4 header sequence]]</ref> (can be placed anywhere appropriate)
*'''Inflection''', ''or'' '''Conjugation''' ''for verbs'', ''or'' '''Declension''' ''for nouns and adjectives'', ''only present in non-English entries''
*'''Quotations''' (when not given under a particular sense)
*'''Synonyms'''
*'''Antonyms'''
*''Other allowable -nyms''
*'''Coordinate terms'''<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2012-03/Moving "Coordinate terms" up in ELE]]</ref>
*'''Derived terms'''
*'''Related terms'''
*'''Descendants'''
*'''Translations''' (only present in English entries)
*'''See also'''
*'''References'''
*'''External links'''

====Usage notes====
This section, whether identified by a heading or indent level may come anywhere.  It should follow as closely as possible after the point that needs explaining.  Curb the tendency to be long winded in this section; brief explicit notes tend to be more effective.  These notes should not take the place of restrictive labels when those are adequate for the job.  Be prepared to document these notes with references.  Remember to describe how a term is used, rather than try to dictate how it should be used from your point of view.

:''The vote “[[Wiktionary:Votes/2007-10/style for mentioned terms|2007-10/style for mentioned terms]]” is relevant to this section, without specifying text to be amended in this document, so please see it for details.''

====Quotations====
:''Main article: [[Wiktionary:Quotations]]''

Quotations are generally placed under the definition which they illustrate.  If there is more than one being provided, or where this is not possible (e.g., a very early usage that does not clearly relate to a specific sense of the word), a separate section should be used.  Quotations here are formatted normally but without definition numbers.

* '''1561''', Flat Footed (translator), Platypus (author), ''Odes'', chapter 3, line 12:
*: The '''hrunk''' it '''hrunketh''' every day.

====Synonyms====
This is a list of words that have similar meanings as the word being defined.  They are often very inexact.

Where several definitions of the headword<ref name=2010-08/> exist, synonyms should be given in a separate list for each meaning.

The following approach is suggested:
# Summarise the definition for which synonyms are being given, putting it in ''italics'' between [[parentheses]], followed by a [[colon]].
# List the synonyms for this definition, in alphabetical order and separated by commas, [[wikify]]ing each synonym.
# Use one line for each synonym, beginning each line with a [[bullet]].

The synonyms section for “hrunk” might look like this (the synonyms are also made up):
* (''flrink with cumplus''): [[flrink]], [[pigglehick]]
* (''furp''): [[furp]], [[whoodleplunk]]

An alternative to identical lengthy lists of synonyms in many entries is offered by [[Wiktionary:Wikisaurus|Wikisaurus]] entries.  Instead of listing many synonyms in each of several synonymous entries, a single reference can be made in each to a common Wikisaurus page.  See [[corpse]], [[body]], [[Wikisaurus:corpse]], [[Wikisaurus:body]] for examples.

====Further semantic relations====
The following headers are available to define sections containing semantically related words other than synonyms: Antonyms, Hypernyms, Hyponyms, Meronyms, Holonyms, Troponyms, Coordinate terms, See also.

Each of these sections is formatted exactly like the Synonyms section (see above).  More detailed information can be found on [[Wiktionary:Semantic relations]].

====Derived terms====
List terms in the same language that are morphological derivatives. For example, the noun ''[[driver]]'' is derived, by addition of the suffix ''[[-er]]'', from the verb ''to [[drive]]''. If it is not known from which part of speech a certain derivative was formed it is necessary to have a “Derived terms” header on the same level as the part of speech headings.

====Related terms====
List words in the same language that have strong etymological connections but aren’t derived terms. Each such term should be wikified. For example, ''[[datum]]'' and ''[[data]]'' should point to each other in this section since the latter is the plural of the former, and the plural form is not obtained by morphological derivation but was taken directly from Latin (where it is a morphological derivation). Another example is the pair of nouns ''[[pendant]]'' and ''[[pennant]]''. These should cross-reference each other as they have very similar (arguably identical) etymologies in some subsenses.

====Descendants====
List terms in other languages that have borrowed or inherited the word. The etymology of these terms should then link back to the page.

====Translations====
:''See [[Wiktionary:Translations]] for more.''

*'''ONLY add translations that you are CERTAIN of.''' If you aren’t familiar with a language, or aren’t sure of a particular translation, it is far better not to add it than to risk adding an incorrect translation.
*'''NEVER use automatic translation software''' to generate translations from English into a language you don’t speak. Automatic translations into English are likewise problematic. Translation software rarely gives accurate results.
*'''DO NOT COPY from translating dictionaries''' (bilingual or multilingual) as this may constitute copyright violation.  This applies to dictionaries both in print form and online.  Dictionaries that are [[public domain|out of copyright]] may be used.

Translations are to be given for English words '''only'''.  In entries for foreign words, only the English translation is given, instead of a definition.  Any translation between two foreign languages is best handled on the Wiktionaries in those languages.

English inflected forms will not have translations. For example, {{term|paints|lang=en}} will not, as it is the plural and third-person singular of {{term|paint|lang=en}}. In such entries as have additional meanings, these additional meanings should have translations. For example, the noun {{term|building|lang=en}} should have translations, but the present participle of {{term|build|lang=en}} will not.<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2011-02/Disallowing translations for English inflected forms]]</ref>

The translation section is separated into a number of divisions that are keyed to the various meanings of the English word. Each division is separated into a distinct collapsible navigation box by use of the translation section templates (see below for example.)  The boxes are each headed by a summary of the translated meaning.

Within each box, the languages for which translations exist are listed in two columns by their English names in alphabetical order. The language name is preceded by a bullet (generated by <nowiki>*</nowiki>) followed by a colon and the translations into that language. The two columns within the collapsible navigation box are obtained by adding the {{temp|trans-top}} template just before the first language, {{temp|trans-mid}} halfway down (which is typically, but not always, between the languages beginning with A-I and those beginning with J-Z), and {{temp|trans-bottom}} at the line after the last translation.<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2006-12/Change style standard to use new trans-top style templates]]</ref>

=====Translation dos and don’ts=====
* '''Do''' use the {{temp|t}} template for each translation.<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2008-12/t template in WT:ELE]]</ref> This will create a link to that word in this Wiktionary and a small link to the Wiktionary for that language.<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/2006-12/Translations with or without interwiki links]]</ref><ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/2006-12/"Translations - wiki links"]]</ref><ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/2007-01/Translations - wiki links (run off)]]</ref><ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/2007-03/Translations - wiki links clarify 3]]</ref>  References for the translation should be on that other page rather than in the translation list.  If you think {{temp|t}} is too complex, simply enclose the translation in square brackets.

* '''Do''' add a transliteration or romanization of a translation into a language that does not use the Roman alphabet. Note however that only widespread romanization systems may be used. See [[Wiktionary:Transliteration]].

* '''Do''' provide the grammatical gender of the translations of nouns, if appropriate, giving the parameters m, f, n and c for “masculine”, “feminine”, “neuter” and “common” respectively to {{temp|t}}.

* '''Do not''' add the pronunciation of the translation or detailed grammatical information: such information should be provided on the page for the translation itself.

* '''Do''' ensure that multiple translations are given in full. For example, for the German for “ankle”, which is ''Knöchel'' or ''Fußknöchel'', write:
*:*German: {{t|de|Knöchel|m}}, {{t|de|Fußknöchel|m}}
:rather than just combining the two as “(Fuß-) Knöchel” or similar, which is liable to be misunderstood.

* '''Do not''' give literal (word-for-word) translations of idioms, unless the literal translation is what is actually used in the [[target language]]. Most idioms do not translate word for word. For example, the idiom “none of your beeswax” cannot be translated into German literally as “nicht dein Bienenwachs”, as this does not have the same meaning in German; an idiomatic translation is “nicht dein Bier” (which means, literally, “not your beer” in English).

* '''Do not''' give translations back into English of idiomatic translations. For example, when translating “bell bottoms” into French as “pattes d’éléphant”, do not follow this with the literal translation back into English of “elephant’s feet”. While this sort of information is undoubtedly interesting, it belongs in the entry for the translation itself.

Here is an example (a shortened version of the entry for ''[[orange]]'') illustrating some of the conventions:<ref name=2010-08>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2010-08/Minor policy page changes]]</ref>

=====Translating words, which are not lemmas in a target language=====
* When a translation in the target language is not a lemma form, use <tt>alt</tt> parameter to display the translation but use lemma-forms as the page name, e.g. the Russian translation of [[asleep]] links to the Russian verb {{l|ru|спать|tr=spatʹ}} ("to sleep") but displays "спящий" (lit. "sleeping"), which is an equivalent of "asleep".
<pre>
...
* Russian: {{t+|ru|спать|tr=spjáščij|alt=спящий|sc=Cyrl}}
...
</pre>

=====Translating words without an exact equivalent in the target language=====
* When there is no single word equivalent in the target language, use {{temp|l}} to provide translations using multiple words, e.g. the Russian translation of [[livelihood]]:

<pre>
...
* Russian: {{l|ru|средство|средства}} {{l|ru|к}} {{l|ru|существование|существованию}} (srédstva k suščestvovániju) {{n|p}}
...
</pre>

* Non-lemma forms are separated in {{temp|l}} from page name (linked forms) using an additional "|" (works similarly <tt>alt</tt> parameter in {{temp|t}}).

====Anagrams and other trivia====
:''Main article: [[Wiktionary:Anagrams]]''

Anagrams may be entered in alphabetical order under a level 3 header <nowiki>===Anagrams===</nowiki>. Only list anagrams that are words in the same language. You may include the [[alphagram]] which is not wikied unless it is itself a word. For [[post]], the anagrams section would look like this:<ref><s>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2009-12/Modify anagram section of ELE]]</s></ref><ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2011-11/Update ELE anagram format]]</ref>

<pre>
* [[opts]], [[pots]], [[spot]], [[stop]], [[tops]]
</pre>

Other sections with other trivia and observations may be added, either under the heading “Trivia” or some other suitably explanatory heading.  Because of the unlimited range of possibilities, no formatting details can be provided.

====References====
The validity of the dictionary has a profound effect on its usefulness. There is a need to balance respect for copyrights with definitions so inventive as to be inaccurate. References to dubious claims, such as the etymology of ''[[windhover]]'', are also important to the credibility of Wiktionary. In due course, every entry should have one or more references which can be used to verify the content.

References here may be given in a normal bibliographic format showing author, title, place of publication, publisher and year of publication. [[:Category:Reference templates|Reference templates]] (beginning with “R:”) are used for some of the most common sources.  Thus, for the 1913 Webster, we have <nowiki>{{R:Webster 1913}}</nowiki>, which gives:

{{R:Webster 1913}}

===Metadata===
This is material which is edited in a regular edit box, but does not appear in the entry when it is read.  In some cases where it appears depends on your user preferences, especially the skin that you have chosen.

====Category links====
A [[Wiktionary:Categorization|Wiktionary category]] is a group of related entries which are listed on a category page.  Sub-categories may also appear on that page.  Categories and lists under various names may seem very similar, but the way they are built is very different; in most cases, but especially in open-ended lists, they complement each other.

To include an entry in a category, simply add a category tag to the entry thus:

<pre>
[[Category:Category name]]
</pre>

The link will appear at the bottom of the page in some skins and at the top in others, regardless of where it is placed in the edit box. Category links are placed one per line at the end of the appropriate language section.<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/2007-05/Categories at end of language section]]</ref> Putting these tags in a consistent place makes them easier to find in a longer entry’s edit field.  A category link appears red if its category page has not yet been described, but categorized entries will appear there.  You should edit a new category page, usually to add a brief description of the category and adding one or more tags to place it in a higher-level category.

By convention, it is preferable to use the plural for most category names that are nouns.  This will avoid having a category divided in two when some use the plural and some use the singular.

====Interwiki links====
An Interwiki link is a link to an entry of the same spelling in another Wiktionary.  The links start with the (usually two-letter) language code.  The syntax is:

<pre>
[[lc:ForeignPageTitle]]
</pre>

The result will be that the entry at [[friend]] can link to the French Wiktionnaire’s version of “friend” using <nowiki>[[fr:friend]]</nowiki>.  And the entry at [[ami]] can link to the French Wiktionnaire’s version of “ami” using <nowiki>[[fr:ami]]</nowiki>.    So, on the English wiktionary, there is both [[friend]] and [[ami]].

Where such links have been established a list of the linked languages will appear together at a place that depends on the skin that you are using; usually the far left column below the search box.  Clicking on a language link will bring you to the entry named ''ForeignPageTitle'' in that language on that other Wiktionary.

Interwiki links are best placed as the last item in an entry alphabetically, each on its own line for ease of editing.  Some of these links are generated by a [[bot]] that compares the various Wiktionary projects.

Newcomers sometimes inadvertently remove Interwiki links, perhaps because they don’t appear to do anything on the page.  A single polite explanation is normally successful in curbing that practice.

Note also that for main namespace entries, interwikis are not used in the translation section.  An interwiki link provides a link to this same page, explained and written in a different language.  Experimental translation interwiki links that need to stay in the translations section must begin with a colon before the language code.  The colon has the effect of forcing the link to appear where it is written.

Lastly, note that interwiki links should only be entered manually if you are certain no interwiki bot runs for a given language; interwiki links are normally entered by bots in an automated fashion.

@ floccinaucinihilipilification
$ ==English==
{{wikiquote}}
===Etymology===
A jocular coinage, apparently by pupils at [[w:Eton College|Eton]], combining a number of roughly synonymous Latin stems. The word was inspired by a line in the ''Eton Latin Grammar'' that listed verbs that govern a genitive noun: "Flocci, nauci, nihili, pili, assis, hujus, teruncii, his verbis, aestimo, pendo, facio, peculiariter adduntur."<ref>''The Spectator'': 11 June 2011</ref>  {{etyl|la}} ''flocci'', from ''[[floccus]]'', a wisp or piece of wool + ''nauci'', from ''[[naucum]]'', a trifle + ''nihili'', from the {{etyl|la}} pronoun, {{term|nihil||nothing|lang=la}} + ''pili'', from ''[[pilus]]'', a hair, something insignificant (all therefore having the sense of "pettiness" or "nothing") + [[-fication]].

===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|/ˌflɒksɪˌnɒsɪˌnɪhɪlɪˌpɪlɪfɪˈkeɪʃən/|/ˌflɒksɪˌnɔːsɪˌnaɪɪlɪˌpɪlɪfɪˈkeɪʃən/}}, {{X-SAMPA|/%flQksI%nQsI&nIhIlI%pIlIfI"keIS@n/|/%flQksI%nO:sI%naIIlI%pIlIfI"keIS@n/}}

===Noun===
{{en-noun|-}}

# The act or habit of describing or regarding something as [[unimportant]],  of having no value or being [[worthless]].
#* '''1741:''' [[w:William Shenstone|William Shenstone]], ''Letters'',
#*: I loved him for nothing so much as his '''flocci-nauci-nihili-pili-fication''' of money.

#*: There is a systematic '''flocci-nauci-nihili-pilification''' of all other aspects of existence that angers me.

Often cited as the longest non-technical word in the English language, being one letter longer than the commonly-cited [[antidisestablishmentarianism]].

@ Wiktionary:Page deletion guidelines
$ {{policy-TT|Page deletion guidelines}}[[fr:Wiktionnaire:Suppression]]
{{shortcut|WT:DELETE}}

==What to delete and what to keep==

* When in doubt, it is usually better to give the benefit of the doubt to keeping the article.  This has a positive effect on the overall communal mental health.
* The general rule is that anything that doesn’t meet the criteria on [[Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion]] is a candidate for deletion.
* Any of the following may be the basis for a deletion request, though there is often a better alternative.
*# '''Complete Rubbish:'''  The contents don’t make sense or are clearly someone’s idea of a joke.  If the material is clearly obscene or libellous, you should also edit the page to a blank state.  Before you request to delete, try to make sure that the article doesn’t fall under “Never heard the word” or “Good title, garbage content” below.
*# '''Title misspelled:'''  Move the article to the correct title.  If there is already an article at the correct title merge any useful material on there.  Occasionally, a misspelling may be so common that it needs to be noted, or it may be an accepted variant spelling of the word.  In that case the article should be retained, but reduced to a simple explanation of the situation.  In the case of alternate spellings, the substantive article may be under either spelling.  Preference should be given to the more common spelling, but where this cannot be determined give preference to the spelling under which the article was first created.
*# '''Contents have been moved to another project:'''  Depending on the reason for the move, an article for the term may still be warranted, but you are under no obligation to write it, or to save inappropriate material while you wait for someone else to do it.  If you make a request to delete it will give some new user a chance to start afresh, though at the expense of losing track of any useful work the original poster may have done.  
*# '''Protologisms''' (i.e. words that have been made up by the poster) have their place in [[Appendix:List of protologisms]]. Usually, it is decided during the [[WT:RFD|RFD]] process whether a word deserves listing, but you can also be bold and add it yourself. The remaining entry can then be tagged by {{temp|delete}} to be deleted.
*# '''Self-promotion:''' Pages which appear to promote some specific person or entity are discouraged, but should not be removed without time for discussion on [[Wiktionary:Requests for deletion]].  Widely-used trademarks are generally OK, since including them in Wiktionary is not likely to have any significant impact. The main concern is that Wiktionary not be used as a vehicle to promote a person or entity.
*# '''Licence violations:''' Pages whose content has been copied from another source, where that source is protected by a current copyright or otherwise incompatible with our Terms of Use.
*# '''Good title, garbage content:''' Someone either didn’t know what they were doing, or was having their idea of fun.
*## Check the history.  If a legitimate entry has been overwritten, click on the link for that version, click on “Edit”, and save with the comment “rv vandalism”.
*## If not, but you can provide a good definition, do so.
*## If you don’t have anything meaningful to put there it is better to delete the page; this will leave all links to the page in red telling everyone that the page still needs to be done.  
* Things to Keep
*#Stubs: These are not the problem that they are in Wikipedia.  Some short short articles are satisfactorily complete when they only describe that a particular word as a variant spelling of another, or that it is an inflected form.
*#Frequently occurring misspellings and ungrammatical forms:  This is not a mandate to keep all manner of misspelled words and typos; there should be an instructive quality to the retention.  These should explain the error and link to the correct form.  Forms with diacritics missing should also be kept, explained and linked to the correct spelling.  For example, [[Worterbuch]] contains the text <nowiki>German without umlaut, see [[Wörterbuch]]</nowiki>.

===User pages for non-existent users===
User pages may have been inadvertently deleted for this method.  Simply checking for “User contributions” to appear is not enough - check [[Special:Listusers]] in each case first.  Apparently after the username is created, the user is still not logged in, initially.  This causes their user page (typically their first edit) to be entered by an anonymous IP.

==How to do it==
*If, having read the above, you feel sure an entry should be deleted:
*#Put '''<nowiki>{{rfd}}</nowiki>''' at the top of the article so that anyone working on the article in the future knows that it may be deleted.
*# Add a link to the unwanted page in [[Wiktionary:Requests for deletion]].
*# Include a brief explanation as to why you think the page should be deleted.
*# Sign your suggestion for deletion (use four tildes, <nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>, to sign with your user name and the current date).  This will allow people to contact you in case of questions about your proposal.
*Then just wait!  If there is no objection to deleting the page, or a clear consensus emerges to delete, an [[Wiktionary:Administrators|administrator]] will come along to do the work, and will update the request page.  A record of the deletion will automatically appear in the [[Wiktionary:Deletion log]].

==Notes to administrators==
Administrators have no special status in determining which pages to delete.  Their job is to implement the consensus of the community.  If there is any uncertainty about whether there is such a consensus, it is safer not to delete the page, but instead flag it RFD or RFV.

Some entries are clearly rubbish and should be speedily deleted. However the following checks, as a minimum, should always be made:
# Check to see if it’s in any other dictionary, for example using  [http://www.onelook.com onelook]. [http://www.urbandictionary.com Urbandictionary] and the like do not count as ''dictionaries''. If it can be found, rewrite, format, RFV or RFC the page as required.
# Check Google. Google can easily throw up hits for random strings of letters. This means that likely pages need to be read to see how the entry is used.
#*If lots of web pages can be found that support the disputed page, then RFC or format the page as required.
#*If only a few pages can be found that support the disputed page, then RFD or RFV the page.
#*If at most a handful of web pages support the disputed page, then delete it.

If a solution other than deletion has been found for a page, it can be useful to add the reasoning to the talk page of the article, so that everybody can see why the page was retained.

===To delete a page===
# Click on ''What links here'', and fix any links that are going to be broken.
# Delete the talk page and any subpages first, since these are not automatically deleted along with the page.
# Delete the page.
# If the page is listed on [[Wiktionary:Requests for deletion]] or [[Wiktionary:Requests for verification]], add a comment saying that it was deleted.

==Undeletion==
If a page gets deleted accidentally, it remains in a state from which it can be [[undeleted]] for a while. Anyone with delete authority also has undelete authority. If you consider that a page has been deleted unfairly you could either
# create it again (this may annoy people), or
# ask an administrator to undelete it, giving a valid reason.  The optimal situation is to address this to the administrator who deleted it in the first place, as they might have had cause to delete it that another admin would not be aware of.

=====Usage notes=====
* {{term|may|May}} is now a [[defective verb]].  It has no infinitive, no past participle, and no future tense.  Forms of {{term|to be allowed to}} are used to replace these missing tenses.
* The simple past (both indicative and subjunctive) of {{term|may}} is {{term|might}}
* The present tense is negated as {{term|may}} {{term|not}}, which can be contracted to {{term|mayn't}}, although this is old-fashioned; the simple past is negated as {{term|might}} {{term|not}}, which can be contracted to {{term|mightn't}}.
* {{term|may|May}} has archaic second-person singular present indicative forms {{term|mayest}} and {{term|mayst}}.
* Usage of this word in the sense of {{term|possibly}} is considered incorrect by some speakers and writers, as it blurs the meaning of the word in the sense ''have permission to''. These speakers and writers prefer to use the word {{term|might}} instead.
* Wishes are often cast in the imperative rather than the subjunctive mood, not using the word {{term|may|may}}, as in ''Have a great day!'' rather than ''May you have a great day''.

=====Synonyms=====
* {{sense|have permission to}} [[can]], [[could]], [[might]]
* {{sense|possibly}} [[could]], [[might]]
* {{sense|in subjunctive}} [[might]]

===Noun===
{{en-noun|s|-}}

# The characteristics of a society, city etc. which has many different [[ethnic]] or [[national]] cultures mingling freely; political or social policies which support or encourage such [[coexistence]]. {{defdate|from 20th c.}}
#* '''1991''', Barbara Ehrenreich, ''Time'', 8 Apr 1991:
#*: Something had to replace the threat of communism, and at last a workable substitute is at hand. "'''Multiculturalism'''," as the new menace is known, has been denounced in the media recently as the new McCarthyism, the new fundamentalism, even the new totalitarianism -- take your choice.
#* '''2005''', David Davis MP, ''Daily Telegraph'', 3 Aug 2005:
#*: Britain has pursued a policy of '''multiculturalism''' - allowing people of different cultures to settle without expecting them to integrate into society.
#* '''2011''', "On a mat and a prayer", ''The Economist'', 7 Apr 2011:
#*: Earlier this year he said '''multiculturalism''' had “failed”, that immigrants needed to “melt” into French society, and that “we do not want ostentatious prayers in the street in France.”

@ Help:How to edit a page
$ To start editing, click the {{MonobookTab|edit}} tab at the top of a Wiktionary entry (but, obviously, not until you’ve finished reading this).

The [[w:MediaWiki|software]] that powers Wiktionary is designed to make editing as easy as possible, but there are going to be a few strange things. That’s because you can create ''far more than just plain text''.

==Formatting==
The '''single quote''' (or apostrophe) character ' has the following special uses for formatting text:
*''Italic text'' is generated by typing two single quotes before and after the characters you want italicised, like this: <code><nowiki>''Italic text''</nowiki></code>.
*'''Bold text''' is generated by typing three single quotes before and after the characters you want bolded: <code><nowiki>'''Bold text'''</nowiki></code>.
* You can of course combine the two to get '''''bold italic text''''' by using five single quotes: <code><nowiki>'''''bold italic text'''''</nowiki></code>.
*: Or, as is used in our example sentences, you can have an ''italic sentence with '''bold italic words''' in it'':
*::<code><nowiki>... an ''italic sentence with '''bold italic words''' in it''</nowiki></code>.
*A single quote by itself has no special effect, so you can make words containing apostrophes ''italicised'' or '''bold''' too:
*:Typing <code><nowiki>my ''dog's'' ball</nowiki></code> gives you my ''dog's'' ball.
*:Typing <code><nowiki>my '''dog's''' ball</nowiki></code> gives you my '''dog's''' ball.
*:For possessives ending with an apostrophe: 
*::For the ''Jones''' house, type <code><nowiki>the ''Jones''' house</nowiki></code>.
*::For the '''Jones'''' house, type <code><nowiki>the '''Jones'''' house</nowiki></code>.
*::For the '''''Jones'''''' house, type <code><nowiki>the '''''Jones'''''' house</nowiki></code>.
*The double quote " character has no special effect and can be used "normally" around or within italics and/or bold text:
*:He said, "now ''you'' too '''''can''''' type '''some "bold" words''' or ''some "italic" words''."
*::<code><nowiki>He said, "now ''you'' too '''''can''''' type '''some "bold" words''' or ''some "italic" words''."</nowiki></code>
*We '''don't use underlining''' because it makes text look like links.

==Basic Lines==
Looking at a dictionary entry, you can see that a lot of lines are different. For example definitions are numbered, translations have a bullet point, example sentences are indented…
* Numbered lines are made by <code><nowiki># Starting the line with a # sign</nowiki></code>
*# Starting the line with a # sign
*# They should be used only for definitions
* Bullet pointed lines are created for lines <code><nowiki>* Starting with a * sign</nowiki></code>
** Starting with a * sign
** They are used for any kind of list, in particular in translations.
* Indented lines are those <code><nowiki>: Starting with a : sign</nowiki></code>
*: Starting with a : sign
*: These are used for example sentences in conjunction with # in the definitions section, and in discussions
* It is possible to combine these, to create lists within lists – as I have done here, by putting two characters together.
*# <code><nowiki>#</nowiki></code>An example definition
*#: <code><nowiki>#:</nowiki></code>''With an '''example''' sentence''.

==Links==
Linking is one of the main benefits of a wiki like this. Links enable one-click navigation between related pages.

Although we haven’t used many on this page, you will often see [[blue]] text around, or occasionally [[Talk:--error: Link target missing--|red]] text. These are both links: the blue indicates that an entry exists (though not necessarily in the right language), the red that the entry does not exist yet and ''may'' need creating.

Words in ''lists'' always get linked, otherwise there is little point in having the list. Deciding when to use links in prose requires a bit of judgment; more detailed guidance may be found at [[Wiktionary:Links]].
# The use of an [[unusual]] word in a definition should be linked.
# As should any technical terms that the [[context]] requires.

Here are some basics of '''how''' to make links. Although basic links are simple, linking effectively can be much neater, so a quick whiz through how to link:
*A general link is created by typing double square brackets around the term, <code><nowiki>[[thusly]]</nowiki></code>, which is rendered [[thusly]].
*:Links in Wiktionary are '''case sensitive''' so  <code><nowiki>[[Thusly]]</nowiki></code>  doesn't work: [[Thusly]].
*Links should point to the main form of a word, and not its plurals or past tenses. In many cases this is easy:
*:To get [[want]]ed to link to "want" you type  <code><nowiki>[[want]]ed</nowiki></code>
*In cases where a term won't fit nicely like that, you have to tell it exactly what "target" page you want by using the "pipe" symbol | between the target and the term, like this:  <code><nowiki>[[target page|text to link from]]</nowiki></code>
*:For example, if the text word you want to link from is the plural "fora", the target entry is the singular "forum", so you type  <code><nowiki>[[forum|fora]]</nowiki></code>  and it displays [[forum|fora]], but clicking it will take you to "forum".
*:For idioms like [[help oneself|help yourself]] Wiktionary uses the neutral pronoun ‘one’ so <code><nowiki>[[help oneself|help yourself]]</nowiki></code>.
*A link can be made to a '''section''' of a page using the hash symbol #. This can be effective to link to specific sections in large pages:
*:To link to the "Writing definitions" section in "Help:FAQ", type  <code><nowiki>[[Help:FAQ#Writing definitions]]</nowiki></code>, giving  [[Help:FAQ#Writing definitions]].
*:To link to a particular etymology's part of speech (POS) section of an entry, like the 2nd etymology noun for the word "gloss", put a number after the POS, like this:  <code><nowiki>[[gloss#Noun 2]]</nowiki></code>, which gives you [[gloss#Noun 2]]. (Be aware though that even if the entry for the "target" term is well-settled, the number and/or order of etymologies, POS and definitions may change, and your link may end up pointing to a different one! See [[Help talk:How to edit a page#Linking to a particular definition]].)
*Always '''''check  before saving the page''''' that links you create or edit take you where you intend them to. After clicking the "Show preview" button, use the link to open a new browser tab or new window (so you don't lose your editing session!) and check the resulting page is what you (and other users) would want.

==Headings==
As you will see, on every entry there are numerous headings of different sizes, these are generated by typing <code><nowiki>==Heading==</nowiki></code>. The more equals signs are included, the smaller the heading will be. Wiktionary has very strict [[WT:ELE|Guidelines]] about the use of headings, which I would advise you to read through, when you have the time. But, as an introduction

 ====Synonyms====
which yields:
{{fake==|English}}
{{fake===|Noun}}
{{fake====|Synonyms}}

==Special characters==
You might also want to add characters you can’t type because they aren’t on your keyboard. You will almost certainly find any character you need in the box below the “Save page” button in editing mode. Just select the set of characters you need and have your pick. For a complete list of unicode characters look here: http://www.unicode.org/charts/

==Templates==
One often encounters cryptic abbreviations enclosed by double curly brackets in the code. These are templates and automatically substitute text into the code. So if you need the same piece of code on many pages, creating a template might be a good idea. The string <nowiki>{{xyz}}</nowiki> will cause the page to be displayed as if the content of the page <nowiki>[[Template:xyz]]</nowiki> had been in its place. An example is [[Template:rfc]] which indicates that a page has been marked for clean-up on [[Wiktionary:Requests for cleanup]]. See [[Wiktionary:Index to templates]].

==Signing==
If you are involved in a discussion, be it on a [[Wiktionary:Talk page|talk page]] or on a page such as [[Wiktionary:Requests for deletion]], it is considered [[Wiktionary:Welcome, newcomers#Norms and etiquette|good manners]] to sign your (user) name at the end of your post. Signing is most easily done by typing four tildes (<nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>), which will automatically be converted into your user name (linked to your user page) and a UTC time stamp.

But of course you never sign the actual dictionary entries as they are considered the collaborative work of perhaps many editors like you.

@ Friday
$ {{wikipedia|dab=friday (disambiguation)|friday}}
{{wikipedia|Week-day names}}
==English==

===Etymology===
From {{etyl|ang}} {{term|frigedæg|frīġedæġ|lang=ang}}. Compound of frīġe and dæġ "day", corresponding to late {{etyl|gem-pro|en}} {{recons|Frijjōz dagaz||day of Frigg|lang=gem-pro}}. Compare West Frisian {{term|freed|lang=fy}}, Dutch {{term|vrijdag|lang=nl}}, German {{term|Freitag|lang=de}}, Danish {{term|fredag|lang=da}}.
Old Norse Frigg (genitive Friggjar), Old Saxon Fri, and Old English Frig are derived from Common Germanic Frijjō.[5] Frigg is cognate with Sanskrit prīyā́ which means "wife."[5] The root also appears in Old Saxon fri which means "beloved lady", in Swedish as fria ("to propose for marriage") and in Icelandic as frjá which means "to love."

A calque of Latin ''[[dies Veneris]]'', via an association of the goddess [[Frigg]] with the Roman goddess of love [[Venus]].

===Noun===
{{en-noun}}

# The sixth [[day]] of the [[week]] in many religious traditions, and the fifth day of the week in systems using the [[w:ISO 8601|ISO 8601]] norm; the Biblical sixth [[day]] of a [[week]], the day before the [[Sabbath]], or "day of preparation" in preparation for the Sabbath; the Islamic sabbath; it follows [[Thursday]] and precedes [[Saturday]].
<!--probably just an attributive form of the noun: #An appointment, person (like Man Friday in ''Robinson Crusoe''), or feeling associated with this day of the week.-->

@ Help:Images
$ :''See also: '''[[Wiktionary:Images]]'''.''
[[Image:Glass-Ball.jpg|thumb|right|Example image caption.]]
It is recommended that all pictures be uploaded to [[commons:|Commons]].

==Image preferences==
[[special:userlogin|Logged in users]] can set the size of thumbnails they want in [[special:preferences]] under "files".  The default, used by those not logged in, is 180 [[pixel]]s.  Logged in users can choose from widths of 120px, 150px, 180px, 200px, 250px or 300px. <!-- See [[Wikipedia:Thumbnail size]] for examples. (might write this later) -->

Also under files in [[Special:Preferences]] you can set the size limit of images shown on  [[w:image description page|image description page]]s. By default, if either the width or the height exceeds 800px or 600px respectively, then the image is reduced in size until it fits within those dimensions.  You can choose from sizes of 320x240px, 640x480px, 800x600px, 1024x768px, 1280x1024px, or 10000x10000px.  The last will effectively display all images at 100% resolution.

==Using images==
To incorporate your image in an article you need to use the [[w:Wikipedia:Extended image syntax|image markup]].  As an example in its simplest form, to reproduce the photograph at the top of this page you need to insert the following text into an article:

<pre><nowiki>[[Image:Glass-Ball.jpg|thumb|Example image caption]]</nowiki></pre>

Where the image is called [[:image:Glass-Ball.jpg|Glass-Ball.jpg]]. "thumb" forces the creation of a thumbnail and you should replace "Example image caption" with a caption.

It gets a bit more complex than this&mdash;see [[w:Wikipedia:Image markup]]&mdash;but the vast majority of images should be displayed in the above format.

Please note that the forced-resizing is discouraged on Wiktionary, as it overrides user preferences.  Thumbnails are by default on the right; please do not reposition them on the left or centered.  No formal policy exists to specify if they belong at the top of the entry, or closest to where they are defined.  For pictures describing English words, they seem to work best when opposite the table of contents (by putting the image wikitext before the first heading.)

==Placement==
Images should usually be placed alongside the definition that it illustrates. If there are too many images in a particular section for this placement to be possible an image gallery may be created that is left-aligned (see [[A]] for an example). Galleries are commonly placed at the foot of the Part-of-speech section or in a '''See also''' section.

@ Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion
$ {{policy-CFIELE}}
As an international dictionary, Wiktionary is intended to include “all words in all languages”.
{{shortcut|WT:CFI}}

==General rule==
A term should be included if it's likely that someone would [[run across]] it and want to know what it means. This in turn leads to the somewhat more formal guideline of including a term if it is '''[[attested]]''' and '''[[idiomatic]]'''.

===Terms===
A term need not be limited to a single word in the usual sense. Any of these are also acceptable:
* Compounds and multiple-word terms such as ''[[post office]]''.
* [[idiom|Idiom]]s such as ''[[go on]]'' and ''[[give up the ghost]]''.
* [[proverb|Proverb]]s.
* [[abbreviation|Abbreviation]]s, [[acronym]]s, and [[initialism]]s such as ''[[NBA]]''.
* [[prefix|Prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es such as ''[[re-]]'' and ''[[-ist]]''.
* Characters used in [[ideograph]]ic or [[phonetic]] writing such as [[字]] or [[ʃ]].

===Attestation===
“Attested” means verified through<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2010-11/Attestation in academic journals]]</ref>
#clearly widespread use,
#use in a well-known work, or
#use in permanently recorded media, conveying meaning, in at least three independent instances spanning at least a year (different requirements apply for certain languages).<ref name="2012-04">[[Wiktionary:Votes/2012-04/Languages with limited documentation]]</ref>

Where possible, it is better to cite sources that are likely to remain easily accessible over time, so that someone referring to Wiktionary years from now is likely to be able to find the original source. As Wiktionary is an online dictionary, this naturally favors media such as Usenet groups, which are durably archived by Google. Print media such as books and magazines will also do, particularly if their contents are indexed online. Other recorded media such as audio and video are also acceptable, provided they are of verifiable origin and are durably archived. We do ''not'' quote other Wikimedia sites<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2008-04/WMF jargon]]</ref><ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2010-06/WMF jargon accepted when it meets CFI]]</ref> (such as Wikipedia), but we may use quotations found on them (such as quotations from books available on Wikisource). When citing a quotation from a book, please include the ISBN.

====Conveying meaning====
:''See [[w:use-mention distinction|use-mention distinction]].''
This filters out appearance in raw word lists, commentary on the form of a word, such as “The word ‘foo’ has three letters,” lone definitions, and made-up examples of how a word might be used. For example, an appearance in someone’s online dictionary is suggestive, but it does not show the word actually used to convey meaning. On the other hand, a sentence like “They raised the jib (a small sail forward of the mainsail) in order to get the most out of the light wind,” appearing in an account of a sailboat race, would be fine. It happens to contain a definition, but the word is also used for its meaning.

:''The vote "[[Wiktionary:Votes/2011-06/Redirecting combining characters|2011-06/Redirecting combining characters]]" is relevant to this section, without specifying text to be amended in this document, so please see it for details.''<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/2011-06/Redirecting combining characters]]</ref>

====Number of citations====
For [[WT:Criteria for inclusion/Well documented languages|languages well documented on the Internet]], three citations in which a term is used is the minimum number for inclusion in Wiktionary. For terms in extinct languages, one use in a contemporaneous source is the minimum, or one mention is adequate subject to the below requirements. For all other spoken languages that are living, only one use or mention is adequate, subject to the following requirements:

* the community of editors for that language should maintain a list of materials deemed appropriate as the only sources for entries based on a single mention,
* each entry should have its source(s) listed on the entry or citation page, and
* a box explaining that a low number of citations were used should be included on the entry page (such as by using the {{temp|LDL}} template).<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/2012-06/Well Documented Languages]]</ref>

====Independent====
This serves to prevent double-counting of usages that are not truly distinct. Roughly speaking, we generally consider two uses of a term to be "independent" if they are in different sentences by different people, and to be non-independent if:

* one is a verbatim or near-verbatim quotation of the other; or
* both are verbatim or near-verbatim quotations or translations of a single original source; or
* both are by the same author.

If two or more usages are not independent of each other, then only one of them can be used for purposes of attestation.<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2012-02/Independence]]</ref>

====Spanning at least a year====
This is meant to filter out words that may appear and see brief use, but then never be used again. The one-year threshold is somewhat arbitrary, but appears to work well in practice.

=== Idiomaticity ===
An expression is “idiomatic” if its full meaning cannot be easily derived from the meaning of its separate components.

For example, ''this is a door'' is not idiomatic, but ''[[shut up]]'' and ''[[red herring]]'' are.

Compounds are generally idiomatic, even when the meaning can be clearly expressed in terms of the parts.  The reason is that the parts often have several possible senses, but the compound is often restricted to only some combinations of them.

For example, [[mega-]] can denote either a million (or 2<sup>20</sup>) of something or simply a very large or prominent instance of something.  Similarly [[star]] might mean a celestial object or a celebrity.  But [[megastar]] means "a very prominent celebrity", not "a million celebrities" or "a million celestial objects", and only rarely "a very large celestial object" (capitalized, it is also a brand name in amateur astronomy).

This rule must be applied carefully and is somewhat subjective.  For example, [[bank]] has several senses and [[parking lot]] has an idiomatic sense of "large traffic jam".  However ''bank parking lot'' can’t possibly mean "to put a large traffic jam in a financial institution".  With such clearly wrong interpretations weeded out, the remaining choices are "place to park cars for any of several kinds of business"” or "place to park cars by, for or on a river bank or similar" (as opposed to, say, the ''hill parking lot'').  The whole phrase could plausibly mean either, depending on context (though the first is likely far more common), and so the phrase is not idiomatic.

This criterion is sometimes referred to as the ''fried egg test'', as a [[fried egg]] generally means an egg (and generally a chicken egg or similar) fried in a particular way.  It generally doesn't denote a [[scrambled egg]], which is nonetheless cooked by frying.

See [[Wiktionary:Idioms that survived RFD]] for other examples. However, many idioms are clearly idiomatic, for example ''[[red herring]]''.  These tests are invoked only in discussion of unclear cases.

Phrasebook entries are very common expressions that are considered useful to non-native speakers. Although these are included as entries in the dictionary (in the main namespace), they are not usually considered in these terms. For instance, ''[[What's your name?]]'' is clearly a summation of its parts.

:''The vote "[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2009-12/Unidiomatic multi-word phrases to meet CFI when the more common spelling of a single word]]" adds a criterion for inclusion without specifying text to be amended in this document, so please see it for the additional criterion.''<ref>([[WT:COALMINE]]) [[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2009-12/Unidiomatic multi-word phrases to meet CFI when the more common spelling of a single word]]</ref>

===Spellings===
<span id="Misspellings, common misspellings and variant spellings">Misspellings, common misspellings and variant spellings</span>:<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2011-02/Renaming CFI section for spellings]]</ref> There is no simple hard and fast rule, particularly in English, for determining whether a particular spelling is “correct”. A person defending a disputed spelling should be prepared to provide references for support.<ref>[[Wiktionary:Beer parlour#Deleting "his" in CFI]]</ref> Published grammars and style guides can be useful in that regard, as can statistics concerning the prevalence of various forms.

Most simple typos are much rarer than the most frequent spellings. Some words, however, are frequently misspelled. For example, ''occurred'' is often spelled with only one ''c'' or only one ''r'', but only ''occurred'' is considered correct. The misspellings may well merit entries.

It is important to remember that most languages, including English, do not have an academy to establish rules of usage, and thus may be prone to uncertain spellings. This problem is less frequent, though not unknown, in languages such as Spanish where spelling may have legal support in some countries.

Regional or historical variations are not misspellings. For example, there are well-known differences between British and American spelling. A spelling considered incorrect in one region may not occur at all in another, and may even dominate in yet another.

====Formatting====
Once it is decided that a misspelling is of sufficient importance to merit its own page, the formatting of such a page should not be particularly problematical. The usual language and part of speech headings can be used, followed by a simple definition using the following format:

:<tt><nowiki># {{misspelling of|occurred|lang=en}}</nowiki></tt>

An additional section explaining why the term is a misspelling should be considered optional.

===Inflections===
The entries for such inflected forms as {{term|cameras}}, {{term|geese}}, {{term|asked}}, and {{term|were}} should indicate what form they are, and link to the main entry for the word ({{term|camera}}, {{term|goose}}, {{term|ask}}, or {{term|be}}, respectively, for the preceding examples). Except with multi-word idioms, they should not merely redirect.

At entries for inflected forms with idiomatic senses, such as {{term|blues}} and {{term|smitten}}, predictable meanings should be distinguished from idiomatic ones.<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2008-08/Inclusion of regular inflected forms]]</ref>

==Idiomatic phrases==
Many phrases take several forms. It is not necessary to include every conceivable variant. When present, minor variants should simply redirect to the main entry. For the main entry, prefer the most generic form, based on the following principles:

===Pronouns===
Prefer the generic personal pronoun, ''one'' or ''one’s''. Thus, ''[[feel one's oats|feel one’s oats]]'' is preferable to ''feel his oats''. Use of other personal pronouns, especially in the singular, should be avoided except where they are essential to the meaning.

===Articles===
Omit an initial article unless it makes a difference in the meaning. E.g., [[cat's pajamas|cat’s pajamas]] instead of [[the cat's pajamas|the cat’s pajamas]].

===Verbs===
Use the infinitive form of the verb (but without “to”) for the principal verb of a verbal phrase. Thus for the saying ''It’s raining cats and dogs,'' or ''It was raining cats and dogs,'' or ''I think it’s going to rain cats and dogs any minute now,'' or ''It’s rained cats and dogs for the last week solid'' the entry should be (and is) under [[rain cats and dogs]]. The other variants are derived by the usual rules of grammar (including the use of ''it'' with weather terms and other [[impersonal verb]]s).

===Proverbs===
A proverb entry's title begins with a lowercase letter, whether it is a full sentence  or not.  The first word may still be capitalized on its own: 
* ''[[you can't judge a book by its cover]]''
* ''[[Rome wasn't built in a day]]''

==Languages to include==
===Natural languages===
All natural languages are acceptable. However, it is important to note that the question of whether a proposed language is considered a living language, or a dialect of or alternate name for another language is inherently subjective in some cases, and either designation may have political overtones.

:''The vote "[[Wiktionary:Votes/2011-10/Unified Romanian|2011-10/Unified Romanian]]" established that the Moldavian and Romanian lects are treated as one language, Romanian.''<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/2011-10/Unified Romanian]]</ref>
:''The vote "[[Wiktionary:Votes/2011-09/Unified Tagalog|2011-09/Unified Tagalog]]" established that the Filipino and Tagalog lects are treated as one language, Tagalog.''<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/2011-09/Unified Tagalog]]</ref>

====Sign languages====
Terms in signed languages are acceptable as entries, and should be entered as described in the policy document [[Wiktionary:About sign languages]].<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2008-08/Wiktionary:About sign languages]]</ref>

===Constructed languages===
Constructed languages have not developed naturally, but are the product of conscious effort in the fulfillment of some purpose. In general, terms in such languages, particularly languages associated with works of fiction, do not meet the basic requirement that one might run across them and want to know the meaning of their words, since they are only used in a narrow context in which further material on the language is readily available. There are specific exceptions to this general rule, listed below, based on consensus of the Wiktionary community. Esperanto, in particular, is a living language with a sizeable community of fluent speakers, and even some native speakers!

Some individual terms from constructed languages may have been adopted into other languages. These should be treated as terms in the adoptive language, and the origin noted in the etymology, regardless of whether the language as a whole is considered to meet the criteria for inclusion.

*These languages have an apparent consensus (all have ISO 639-3 codes): '''[[Esperanto]], [[Ido]], [[Interlingua]], [[Interlingue]] ([[Occidental]]), [[Lojban]], [[Novial]], [[Volapük]]'''.

*At present another 12 of the 7000 languages in the ISO 639-3 list are constructed languages. Words in 9 of those languages have not yet been approved for inclusion in the English Wiktionary. These are [[Afrihili]], [[Blissymbols]], [[Brithenig]], [[Dutton World Speedwords]], [[Glosa]] ([[Interglossa]]), [[Kotava]], [[Láadan]], [[Lingua Franca Nova]], and [[Romanova]]. The remaining three are prohibited (see below).<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2010-02/Correct figures in CFI]]</ref>

*There is ''no'' apparent consensus for including these additional languages which do not have an ISO 639-3 code: [[Ceqli]], [[D'ni]], [[Delason]], [[Ekspreso]], [[Europanto]], [[Glos]], [[Jakelimotu]], [[Kyerepon]], [[Latejami]], [[Latino sine Flexione]], [[Linga]], [[Romanica]], [[Sasxsek]], [[Suoczil]], [[Tceqli]], [[Toki Pona]].

*There ''is'' consensus that languages whose origin and use are restricted to one or more related literary works and its fans do not merit inclusion as entries or translations in the main namespace. They may merit lexicons in the [[Appendix:Contents|Appendix]] namespace. These languages include [[Quenya]], [[Sindarin]], [[Klingon]], and [[Orcish]] (the first three do have ISO 639-3 codes).<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2007-04/Fictional languages]]</ref>

Even when rejected for treatment as a language for purposes of this Wiktionary, a single article about the name of that language ''may'' be acceptable.

:''The vote [[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2010-12/Clarification of language inclusion|"pl-2010-12/Clarification of language inclusion"]] is relevant to this section and specifies an additional criterion for inclusion in some cases, but did not specify any emendation of the text of this section, so please see that vote for details.''<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2010-12/Clarification of language inclusion]]</ref>

===Reconstructed languages===
Terms in reconstructed languages such as [[Proto-Indo-European]] ''do not meet'' the criteria for inclusion. They may be entered in appendices, and referred to from  etymological sections.<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2006-12/Proto- languages in Appendicies]]</ref> ''See [[Wiktionary:Reconstructed terms]].''

==Exclusions==

===Fictional universes===
Terms originating in fictional universes which have three citations in separate works, but which do not have three citations which are ''independent of reference to that universe'' may be included only in appendices of words from that universe, and not in the main dictionary space.<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2008-01/Appendices for fictional terms]]</ref> With respect to names of persons or places from fictional universes, they shall not be included unless they are used out of context in an attributive sense. See [[Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion/Fictional universes|examples]].

For purposes of defining a single work, a series of books, films, or television episodes by the same author, documenting the exploits of a common set of characters in a fictional universe (e.g. the ''Harry Potter'' books, Tolkien's Middle Earth books, the ''Star Wars'' films), shall be considered a single work in multiple parts.

===Wiktionary is not an encyclopedia===
''See also'' [[Wiktionary:What Wiktionary is not|Wiktionary is not an encyclopaedia]].

Care should be taken so that entries do not become [[encyclopedic]] in nature; if this happens, such content should be moved to [[Wikipedia]], but the dictionary entry itself should be kept.

Wiktionary articles are about words, not about people or places. Many places, and some people, are known by single word names that qualify for inclusion as given names or family names. The Wiktionary articles are about the words. Articles about the specific places and people belong in Wikipedia. For example: Wiktionary will give the etymologies, pronunciations, alternative spellings, and eponymous meanings, of the ''names'' [[Darlington]], [[Hastings]], [[David]], [[Houdini]], and [[Britney]]. But articles on the specific towns ([[w:Darlington|Darlington]], [[w:Hastings|Hastings]]), statue ([[w:David|David]]), escapologist ([[w:Houdini|Houdini]]), and pop singer ([[w:Britney|Britney]]) are Wikipedia's job.

===Language-specific issues===
Individual languages may have additional restrictions on inclusion. These will be mentioned on that language's About page. For instance, [[Wiktionary:About English]] notes that the community has voted<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2007-07/Exclusion of possessive case]]</ref> to not allow most modern English possessives.<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2010-01/Removing Modern English possessive forms section from CFI]]</ref>

==Names==
Names fall into several categories, including company names, the names of products, given names, family names, and the full names of specific people, places{{,}} and things. Wiktionary classifies all as proper nouns, but applies caveats to each.

Generic terms are common rather than proper nouns. For example: [[Remington]] is used as a synonym for any sort of rifle, and [[Hoover]] as a synonym for any sort of vacuum cleaner. (Both are also attested family name words, and are included on that basis as well, of course.<!-- SO this could use BETTER EXAMPLES -->) [[Hamburger]] is used as generic term for a type of sandwich. One good rule of thumb as to whether a name has become a generic word is whether the word can be used without capitalization (as indeed “[[sandwich]]” was in the previous sentence<!-- BUT that’s the WRONG EXAMPLE -->).

===Company names===
'''Being a company name does not guarantee inclusion.''' To be included, the use of the company name other than its use as a trademark (i.e., a use as a common word or family name) has to be attested.

===Brand names===
{{shortcut|WT:BRAND}}
'''A brand name for a product or service should be included if it has entered the lexicon.'''<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2007-08/Brand names of products 2]]</ref><ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2012-02/Brand names and physical product 2]]</ref> Apart from genericized trademarks, this is measured objectively by the brand name’s use in at least three independent durably archived citations spanning a period of at least three years. The sources of these citations:

# must be independent of any parties with economic interest in the brand, including the manufacturer, distributors, retailers, marketers, and advertisers, their parent companies, subsidiaries, and affiliates, at time of authorship; and
# must not identify any such parties.

If the term has legal protection as a trademark, the original source must not indicate such. The sources also must not be written:
# by any person or group associated with the type of product or service;
# about any person or group specifically associated with the product or service; or
# about the type of product or service in general.

The text preceding and surrounding the citation must not identify the product or service to which the brand name applies, whether by stating explicitly or implicitly some feature or use of the product or service from which its type and purpose may be surmised, or some inherent quality that is necessary for an understanding of the author’s intent. See [[Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion/Brand names|examples]].

===Given and family names===
'''Given names (such as [[David]], [[Roger]], and [[Peter]]) and family names (such as [[Baker]], [[Bush]], [[Rice]], [[Smith]], and [[Jones]]) are words, and subject to the same criteria for inclusion as any other words.''' Wiktionary has main articles giving etymologies, alternative spellings, meanings, and translations for given names and family names, and has two appendices for indexing those articles: [[Appendix:Names]], [[Appendix:Surnames/A]].<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2010-01/Renaming given name appendixes]]</ref>

For most given names and family names, it is relatively easy to demonstrate that the word fulfills the criteria, as for most given names and family names the name words are in widespread use in both spoken communication and literature. However, being a name ''per se'' does not automatically qualify a word for inclusion. A new name, that has not been attested, is still a protologism. A name that occurs only in the works of fiction of a single author, a television series or a video game, or within a closed context such as the works of several authors writing about a single fictional universe is not used independently and should not be included.

[[hypocoristic|Hypocoristics]], [[diminutive]]s, and [[abbreviation]]s of names (such as [[Jock]], [[Misha]], [[Kenny]], [[Ken]], and [[Rog]]) are held to the same standards as names.

===Genealogical content===
'''[[Wiktionary:What Wiktionary is not|Wiktionary is not a genealogy database]].''' Wiktionary articles on family names, for example, are not intended to be about the people who share the family name. They are about the name ''as a word''. For example: Whilst [[Yoder]] will tell the reader that the ''word'' originated in Switzerland (as well as give its pronunciations and alternative spellings), it is ''not'' intended to include information about the ancestries of people who have the family name Yoder.<ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2010-01/Renaming CFI section on genealogic names]]</ref>

===Names of specific entities===
This section regulates the inclusion and exclusion of names of specific entities, that is, names of individual people, names of geographic features, names of celestial objects, names of mythological creatures, names and titles of various works, etc.<ref><s>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2010-05/Names of specific entities]]</s></ref><ref><s>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2010-05/Placenames with linguistic information 2]]</s></ref><ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2011-02/Remove "Place names" section of WT:CFI]]</ref><ref>[[Wiktionary:Votes/pl-2010-12/Names of individuals]]</ref> Some examples include the [[Internet]], the [[Magna Carta]], the [[Mona Lisa]], the [[Qur'an]], the [[Red Cross]], the [[Titanic]], and [[World War II]].

A name of a specific entity must not be included if it does not meet the [[Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion#Attestation|attestation]] requirement. Among those that do meet that requirement, many should be excluded while some should be included, but there is no agreement on precise, all-encompassing rules for deciding which are which. However, policies exist for names of certain kinds of entities. In particular:

* No individual person should be listed as a sense in any entry whose page title includes both a given name or diminutive and a family name or patronymic. For instance, Walter Elias Disney, the film producer and voice of Mickey Mouse, is not allowed a definition line at ''Walt Disney''.
* Names of specific companies are subject to the “[[Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion#Company names|Company names]]” section of this page.
* Names of fictional people and places are subject to the “[[Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion#Fictional universes|Fictional universes]]” section of this page.

Such definitions as are included should be succinct rather than encyclopedic.

==Issues to consider==
===Attestation vs. the slippery slope===
There is occasionally concern that adding an entry for a particular term will lead to entries for a large number of similar terms. This is not a problem, as each term is considered on its own based on its usage, not on the usage of terms similar in form. Some examples:

* Any word in any language might be borrowed into English, but only a few actually are. Including [[spaghetti]] does not imply that [[ricordati]] is next (though it is of course fine as an Italian entry).
* Any word may be rendered in pig Latin, but only a few (e.g., [[amscray]]) have found their way into common use.
* Any word may be rendered in [[leet]] style, but only a few (e.g., [[pr0n]]) see general use.
* Grammatical affixes like [[meta-]] and [[-ance]] can be added in a great many more cases than they actually are. (Inflectional suffixes like [[-s]] for the plural of a noun and [[-ed]] for the past tense of a verb can actually be used for almost any noun or verb.)
* It may seem that trendy internet prefixes like ''e-'' and ''i-'' are used everywhere, but they aren’t. If I decide to talk about ''e-thumb-twiddling'' but no one else does, then there’s no need for an entry.

$ {{shortcut|WT:"|WT:QUOTE}}
{{policy-TT}}

== Index to templates ==
Various templates are in use in order to facilitate adding heavily-quoted authors. See [[/Templates]] for a complete list of these.

== How to choose a quotation ==

Ideally, [[quotation]]s should be chosen that:

# Illustrate the meaning by surrounding context,
# Extend the time range that we have quotations for, or fill long time gaps,
# Show a variety of contexts that a word is used in, and
# Show a variety of genres, regions{{,}} and registers that a word is used in.

(In practice it’s usually a lot of effort to meet all these goals at once, but that’s the ideal.)

All quotes should be from works in the language of the word in question, followed by an English translation when appropriate.  If a word is one which is known to have been coined in a specific work in another language (such as [[robot]]) then the information should go in the etymology section rather than the quotations section.

In general, all quotes should be ones that count toward [[Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion#Attestation|the attestation requirement for inclusion]] (such as dateable printed sources), except that the earliest reliably-dated quotation should be included whether or not it counts toward that requirement.

When attesting terms, it is better to cite sources that can be easily verified, providing the ISBN or other useful source information. As Wiktionary is an online dictionary, this naturally favors web-based media such as Google Books, periodicals indexed online, Wikisource, and Usenet. See a list of [[Wiktionary:List of searchable archives|searchable archives]].

== How to format a quotation ==
There are three types of format in practice now, as outlined in the three subsections of this section. You may choose whichever you think is best fitted, but some of the regular contributors adhere closely to one or the other.

Quotations should at all times be ordered from earliest to the most recent.

===Between the definitions===
:''See also [[Wiktionary:Entry layout explained#Example sentences]] and [[Help:Example sentences]].''
If you put the quotations amid the definitions, remember to put them under the appropriate one. This format is most used for a limited number of quotations (one to three). Consider any of the other formats for longer lists.

This is the desired format for these:

# First definition
#* '''Year''', Author, ''Source title'', Publisher, pages #–#:
#*: First quotation of '''word'''.
#*:: Translation [if applicable]
#* '''Year''', Author, ''Source title'', Publisher (publication date of later edition), page #:
#*: '''Words''' of second quotation.
# Second definition
#: etc.

Which is in raw code: 
 <nowiki>
# First definition
#* '''Year''', Author, ''Source title'', Publisher, pages #–#:
#*: First quotation of '''word'''.
#*:: Translation [if applicable]
#* '''Year''', Author, ''Source title'', Publisher (publication date of later edition), page #:
#*: '''Words''' of second quotation.
# Second definition
#: etc.</nowiki>


Please note:
# When quoting a short poem, article or other short work, double quotation marks (<code>“Title”</code>) instead of italicision by two apostrophes (<code><nowiki>''Title''</nowiki></code>) should be used on the title of that work.
# Type faces should be as indicated. The year is always in bold face, the title of the work in italics or, for shorter works, quotation marks.
# The illustration shows the marks that will ensure proper indentation.
# No blank lines are included within these entries.  Blank lines in a numbered list will cause the numbering to be re-started.
# In the quotation itself the word being illustrated should be in boldface.
# If applicable, provide a wikilink to Wikipedia (format: <code><nowiki>[[w:name|]]</nowiki></code>) for the author, a wikilink to Wikisource (format: <code><nowiki>[[s:title|]]</nowiki></code>) for the work. Please make sure the links point to the relevant pages on the other projects.
# The year should be that of the earliest edition known to use the word.  Where practicable, the page number should be taken from the first edition, but if a later edition is used (found in a library or digitised by [http://books.google.com Google Books], etc) then the publication date should be added in parentheses after the publisher’s name.
# If the quotation can be read online, the page number should be wikified as a link to the online source (note: under dispute). Links within the dictionary entry can always be provided with ISBN numbers.
# Quotations should be listed in order of first use of the word being illustrated.
# Generally, the quoted text itself should not contain links. In fact, some/many/most editors think that the quoted text, like example sentences devised by editors, should ''never'' contain links. (Note: This is currently under discussion on this page’s talk page.)

An example, taken from ''[[gully]]'':

# {{context|Scotland and northern UK}} A large knife.
#*'''1883''', [[w:Robert Louis Stevenson|Robert Louis Stevenson]], ''[[s:Treasure Island|Treasure Island]]'', Cignet Classic (1998), page [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0451527046&id=3f2ne_bk-xoC&pg=PA131&lpg=PA131&ots=A_mzPeA12T&dq=gully&sig=IT-VC9zDPaUuVACY1mDpoUXIVQY 131]:
#*: With that I made my mind up, took out my '''gully''', opened it with my teeth, and cut one strand after another<!--,-->''…''.

There is no set format for quotations from Usenet, but here is one example from [[rainburn]]:

# A [[burn]] on the [[skin]] caused by [[excess]] [[exposure]] to heavy [[rain]].
#* '''1991''' June 13, “Mark Grundy” (username), “[http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.frp/msg/97c9ff2b764e4ce5?q=rainburn Plot Seeds/Story: Undead of Purditory]”, in <tt>rec.games.frp</tt>, ''Usenet'':
#*: It started with neck and upper body sores that looked a bit like '''rainburn''' - but usually they had only two or three of them.

The 1913 Webster Dictionary uses quotes but shows '''only''' the quote and the surname of the author, in that order.  The specific work and year is listed for some authors at [[Wiktionary:Abbreviated Authorities in Webster]], but for others it will need to be researched and added, and that is tedious, painstaking work.  Using [[s:Main page|Wikisource]] or [http://books.google.com Google Books] may help significantly.  Expanding the information on these quotes would help Wiktionary’s credibility, but it is not mandatory.  Simply put what you have in the proper order, and someone else can research the added details.  In absence of any information about the author or work, consider paraphrasing the quote as an example sentence instead.

Formerly, quotations were formatted with the quotation itself between the year and author.  This has been changed to accommodate the use of templates for frequently quoted works.  You will also find older additions having “'''Quotations:'''” before the actual quote.  This has also become obsolete, and they can be safely removed.

=== Under a Quotations header ===
Longer lists of quotations may find a more appropriate place in a separate section, as they would hamper readability for people only interested in the definitions.

The appropriate section title is “Quotations”, a level four heading.  Please place the section under the relevant part of speech.  Avoid commingling quotations for different parts of speech.  Also make sure you select appropriate quotes here, that are not ambiguous towards the definitions.

The format is largely the same:

 ====Quotations====
 * '&#39;'Year'&#39;', Author, '&#39;Work title&#39;', Publisher, page #:
 *: First quotation of '&#39;'word'&#39;'.
 *:: Translation [if applicable]
 * '&#39;'Year'&#39;', Author, '&#39;Work title&#39;', Publisher (publication date for later edition), page #:
 *: '&#39;'Words'&#39;' of second quotation.
 etc.

It may also be helpful to show a {{temp|timeline}} of the dates.

=== Subpages ===
In the case of many quotations and references, a subpage should be created in the <tt>Citations</tt> namespace. See [[Wiktionary:Citations]] for more information. Any quotations left within the entry for illustration would be a subset of those on the citations page.

== Which date to use ==

The date corresponds with original authorship, the time that the citation was put into the exact words quoted. Usually this will be approximated as the first year of publication. For a work published posthumously, the date is ''ante'' the year of publication. Preferably the work is a first edition, but otherwise the date of the edition should be placed in the edition section. In contrast, for quotations of translated works, where the translator is noted before the author, the year of translation is stated first. This is true even for borrowed or transliterated terms.

== The use of abbreviations ==

In most cases abbreviations should be avoided unless their usage is almost universal. Those listed below are permitted.

*In place of an authors name
**''anon'' = anonymous author
*After an author’s name
**''ed.'' = editor
**''tr.'' = translator
**''et al.'' = et alia = and others
*Before a year
**''c.'' = ''circa'' or about
**''a.'' = ''ante'' or before
**''p.'' = ''post'' or after

== Debated authorship ==

In a work of which there is mainstream debate (so for instance “Funeral Elegy” would be mainstream debate, but not the first folio of Shakespeare) about who the author is this should be indicated either by listing the suspected authors, or by listing the most likely author and placing the phrase ''(uncertain)'' after the authors name.

== Spelling and typography ==
The reason for including a quotation is because it demonstrates that the word being defined is (or was) used with that meaning. This means that the primary aim when reproducing the quote is to reproduce the meaning as faithfully as is possible. 

It isn’t always possible to reproduce everything about the source on Wiktionary, particularly with older printed works. For these occasions the following rules of thumb should be taken as a guide.

For auditory sources, not discussed below, some interpretation of intent is unavoidable.

In all cases though it is a judgement call for the individual editor to make regarding the individual quotation with which they are working, although it is important to try and be consistent as possible within the same entry.

=== Spelling ===
Reproducing the spelling is important as some variations in spelling can drastically affect the meaning, for example ''[[breath]]'' and ''[[breathe]]'' are different words. As Wiktionary has separate entries for different spellings of the same word (e.g. ''[[colour]]'' and ''[[color]]'') it is vital that the spelling of the word being defined is reproduced.

==== Diacritics ====
The presence or absence of [[diacritic]]s, and which diacritic(s) are used is important to copy accurately. The presence or absence of a diacritic ranges from a matter of stylistic choice which doesn’t affect the meaning at all, through shades of meaning, to being completely different words. For example:

*English ''[[cliché]]'' and ''[[cliche]]'', are identical in meaning and connotations.
*In British English a ''[[café]]'' is usually a higher class establishment than a ''[[cafe]]''
*In English the noun ''[[exposé]]'' is a different word from the verb ''[[expose]]''

Where a diacritic cannot be represented by Unicode characters, the nearest representation that can be shown should be used. If there is a standard convention for the language and/or character in question then this should be followed.

==== Ligatures and archaic letters ====
When rendering modern English texts with [[ligature]]s and archaic letters, as a rule of thumb reproduce the following if they appear in the source text:

*[[Æ]] / [[æ]]
*[[Œ]] / [[œ]]
*[[Þ]] / [[þ]]
*[[Ð]] / [[ð]]
*[[ſ]]

For other characters, reproduce them only if you think they affect the meaning. Otherwise substitute appropriate modern characters.

For other languages, the importance of reproducing ligatures and other characters not used in modern English or the modern character set of that language varies. If you are uncertain, ask others their opinion in the [[WT:TR|Tearoom]] or on the talk page of the “About” page for that language (e.g. [[Wiktionary talk:About Greek]]).

As with diacritics, where a letter or ligature cannot be represented in Unicode, the nearest symbol that can be shown should be used. If there is a standard convention for the language and/or character in question then this should be followed.

=== Punctuation and spacing ===
Generally it is important to reproduce the punctuation of the source accurately, as this can greatly impact the meaning. (Compare “Eats shoots and leaves” with “Eats''',''' shoots and leaves”.)

The number and width of spaces between words or sentences does not normally alter the meaning at all and so while we do normally try and be faithful, it is not wrong or unusual to use just a single ASCII space when reproducing them on Wiktionary. 

Some older works include a (narrow) space before punctuation marks such as colons and semi-colons or between dots of an ellipsis. There is no policy on whether to include these or not, and so it is the individual editor’s choice. When they are included, use a standard width non-breaking space <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> as in the example below:
<pre>For some reason old books sometimes have a space before a semi-colon&nbsp;; like this</pre>

=== Line breaks ===
The importance of line breaks to the meaning of the text is dependent on the type of work. Where it is important to reproduce them, the “[[¶]]” or “/” characters can be used,

:*'''1671''', [[w:John Milton|John Milton]], ''[[w:Paradise Regained|Paradise Regained]]'':
:*: […] / Should kings and nations from thy mouth consult, / Thy counsel would be as the oracle / '''Urim and Thummim''', those oraculous gems / On Aaron’s breast, or tongue of Seers old / &mdash; 

''or''

:*'''1995,''' Joe Simpson, ''This Game of Ghosts'', The Mountaineers Books, ISBN 0898864607:
:*:As Mark came out of the bathroom, I remembered my underpants. ¶ ‘Hey Mark, have you got my '''shreddies'''?’

==== Prose ====
The line breaks in the body text of a work of prose are almost always inconsequential to the meaning of the words. This is because they would occur in different places if the work were printed on different sized paper, in a different text size or in a different typeface. For this reason it is not usually important to render line breaks.

Where explicit line breaks are used in prose, for example to distinguish different speakers in a conversation, they should be reproduced. 

==== Poetry ====
In a poem, the line breaks are often an important part of the work. For example the verse structure, rhyming and or syllable patterns are often dependent on the line breaks. Normally therefore it is appropriate to reproduce all the line breaks in a poetic work. However where a long work has very long verses (for example epic poems) it will often be important just to denote the breaks of verses (although it would be unusual to require more than part of one verse of such a work for citation purposes). Which of these applies to the work is a judgement call for individual editors.

==== Headlines and titles ====
In all works, the headlines and sub-headlines of works are often chosen with a view to them fitting in the space available, and choosing where to break a line can have an impact on the importance placed upon certain words. It is a judgement call for the individual editor whether this was the case for the (sub-)headline in question, but where it was then it should be reproduced.

==== Hyphenation ====
Where a work uses hyphenation for words split across lines, these should normally only be reproduced where the line breaks are explicit (for example some words are purposefully split for rhymes or poetic meter).

The only exception to this is where the word being defined is hyphenated in this manner. In this case it should not  be reproduced, but it should be noted in a HTML comment that the word was split across lines in the original. Where the word has alternate hyphenated and non-hyphenated spellings, where possible it is almost always best to cite from works where the word is not hyphenated for a line-break.

=== Stylized text ===
If a word or phrase appears boldfaced in the original text, then do not replicate the styling since boldface is used to highlight only the headword. Leave an HTML comment indicating the original styling, even if only the headword is boldfaced in the original.

If emphasis is needed, also note any substituted styling, for instance:

 <code><nowiki>A ''defined term''&lt;!--bold instead of italics--&gt; is defined as such.</nowiki></code>

If a word or phrase appears italicized in the original text, then replicate that styling. If the entire quotation must be italicized, leave a comment indicated that this is the correct intent. Other stylized text may be replicated or noted as best as possible.

=== Typography ===
Generally you should reproduce most typography as it is in the source, although this is less important than for the spelling and punctuation. 

As a rule of thumb the style of quotation marks and apostrophes (straight " or curly “) used in the original should always be used on Wiktionary, as should dashes (-- vs —), and any other typography that has an impact on the meaning of the words.

Where it is not possible or not easy to reproduce the typography using standard Unicode characters or simple HTML formatting then do not attempt to do so using other methods. If it is important to the meaning, then you should note in a comment how it is formatted in the original.

===Etymology===
From {{etyl|grc}} {{term|διάλεκτος|tr=diálektos||conversation, the language of a country or a place or a nation, the local [[idiom]] which derives from a dominant language|sc=polytonic}}, from {{term|διαλέγομαι|tr=dialégomai||I participate in a [[dialogue]]|sc=polytonic}}, from {{term|διά|tr=diá||inter, through|sc=polytonic}} + {{term|λέγω|tr=légō||I speak|sc=polytonic}}.

===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|/ˈdaɪ.ə.ˌlɛkt/}}
* {{audio|En-us-dialect.ogg|Audio (US)}}

===Noun===
{{en-noun}}

# {{linguistics}} A variety of a [[language]] (specifically, often a spoken variety) that is characteristic of a particular area, community or group, often with relatively minor differences in vocabulary, style, spelling and pronunciation.
#: ''A language is a '''dialect''' with an army and a navy.''
# A dialect of a language perceived as substandard and wrong.
#* Roger W. Shuy, ''Discovering American dialects'', National Council of Teachers of English, 1967, page 1:
#*: Many even deny it and say something like this: "No, we don't speak a '''dialect''' around here. <nowiki>[...]</nowiki>
#* ''Linguistic perspectives on black English'', H. Carl, 1975, pg. 219:
#*: Well, those children don't speak '''dialect''', not in this school. Maybe in the public schools, but not here.
#* H. Nigel Thomas, ''Spirits in the dark'', Heinemann, 1994, pg. 11:
#*: <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> on the second day, Miss Anderson gave the school a lecture on why it was wrong to speak '''dialect'''. She had ended by saying "Respectable people don't speak '''dialect'''."

====Usage notes====
* The difference between a language and a dialect is not always clear, but it is generally considered that people who speak different dialects can understand each other, while people who speak different languages cannot. Compare '''[[species]]''' in the biological sense.

# {{linguistics}} A branch of [[linguistics]] studying the [[meaning]] of words.
#: '''''Semantics''' is a foundation of lexicography.''
# The study of the relationship between words and their meanings.
#* '''2006''', Patrick Blackburn, Johan Bos, and Kristina Striegnitz, ''[http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&pageid=lpn-htmlse32 Learn Prolog Now!]'', section 8.1:
#*: In fact, nowadays a lot is known about the '''semantics''' of natural languages, and it is surprisingly easy to build semantic representations which partially capture the meaning of sentences or even entire discourses.
# The individual meanings of words, as opposed to the overall meaning of a passage.
#: ''The '''semantics''' of the terms used are debatable.''
#: ''The '''semantics''' of a single preposition is a dissertation in itself.''

====Etymology====
:''"science of meaning in language,"'' 
:1893, from ''Fr. sémantique'' (1883); 
:Replaced semasiology (1847), from ''Ger. Semasiologie'' (1829),
:from ''Gk. semasia'' '''"signification, meaning."'''

===Pronunciation===
* {{a|RP}} {{IPA|/ˌfɒls ˈfrɛnd/|/ˌfɔːls ˈfrɛnd/}}
* {{a|US}} {{IPA|/ˌfɑːls ˈfrɛnd|/ˌfɔːls ˈfrɛnd/}}

===Noun===
{{en-noun|head=[[false]] [[friend]]}}

# {{linguistics|idiomatic}} A [[word]] in a foreign language that bears a [[deceptive]] resemblance to a word in one's own language, but has a different meaning.

====Usage notes====
* Examples:
** The French ''[[nous]] [[demandons]]'' means "''we [[ask]]''", but sounds like "''we [[demand]]''", which can turn negotiation into confrontation.
** The Spanish word ''[[embarazada]]'' means "''[[pregnant]]''", not "''[[embarrassed]]''" &mdash; "''Estoy embarazada''" means "''I am pregnant''", not "''I am embarrassed''".
** The German word ''[[will]]'' ([[want]]) is not a future tense marker &mdash; "''Ich will gehen''" means "''I want to go''", not "''I will go''".
*** Same for Dutch and Afrikaans, "''Ik wil gaan''" and "''Ek wil gaan''" mean "''I want to go''".
** The Italian word ''[[triviale]]'' ([[vulgar]]) is written almost like ''[[trivial]]'', but the two words share only a common Latin root (''[[trivium]]'' in Latin means [[crossroad]]) and no longer any meaning; "''Questo è triviale''" means "''This is in bad taste''", not "''This is obvious''".
** The Danish word ''[[gift]]'' does not mean gift as in present, but can mean a verb form of [[married|to marry]]; ''Han er gift'' means ''He is married''. The word for gift is [[gave]], which is close to the past tense of the verb [[giver]]. If ''du gav en gave'', you gave a gift. Likewise, if ''du gav en gift'', you actually gave [[poison]].

# {{grammar}} A [[word]] that indicates an action, event, or state.
#: ''The word “speak” is an English '''verb'''.''

====Usage notes====
Verbs compose a fundamental category of words in most languages. In an English clause, a verb forms the [[head]] of the [[predicate]] of the clause. In many languages, verbs uniquely [[conjugate]] for [[tense]] and [[aspect]].

====Quotations====
* '''2001''' — [[w:Eoin Colfer|Eoin Colfer]], ''Artemis Fowl'', p 221
*: Then you could say that the doorway exploded. But the particular '''verb''' doesn't do the action justice. Rather, it shattered into infinitesimal pieces.

=Comments "Voting" for a Thesaurus in Wiktionary=
==First Comment==
BTW, I also think this project should be a thesaurus too.  --[[User:Maveric149|Maveric149]]
==The Wiktionary entry for [[Wiktionary]] actually says it will include a Thesaurus==
To quote - "A collaborative project to produce a free and complete dictionary and thesaurus in every language. " 
Though, like everything else in Wiktionary even that could be redefined ! Who is the final arbiter of what the Wiktionary project is about ??--[[User:Richardb|Richardb]] 12:45, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:No one particular person - we tend to thrash things out in the beer parlour and come to some sort of agreement, especially on major changes such as this one.  It tends to be the more regular contributors who determine what happens, for two reasons: we are around a lot to continue the discussion and put our arguments over, and we are the ones who the changes will have the greatest impact on; that said, we aren't the ones who have the final say on what happens or what doesn't - any user who suggests a solution that is popular, effective, useful and consistent with the goals of Wiktionary is likely to win the day. &mdash; [[User:Paul G|Paul G]] 18:02, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)
==there is a case for having a separate thesaurus - Paul G==
::Well, there is a case for having a separate thesaurus, and we have touched on it here at some time in the past.  One of the arguments reason for having a separate thesaurus is to ensure consistency of synonyms.  At the moment, words with lots and lots of synonyms, especially slang terms, have in their entries variable numbers of these synonyms listed.  For example, a word with ''n'' synonyms would, ideally, have ''n'' &ndash; 1 synonyms listed at each of the ''n'' entries for these words.  In practice, we have somewhat less than ''n'' &ndash; 1 synonyms in the lists (in some cases, none at all).  This is not only inconsistent, but unwieldy: every time some comes up with a new synonym, it has to be added to the synonym lists for the other ''n'' entries.

::In the same way that rhymes have their own index (rather than listing all the rhymes for words in their entries), having a separate namespace or project would remove these shortcomings.  We already have it to a very small extent with the translations - when YYY means exactly the same as XXX, and XXX is the more common term, I routinely add add "see XXX" instead of providing translations.  Again, this helps to keep things consistent and more easily maintainable.

::&mdash; [[User:Paul G|Paul G]] 14:22, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)


=Comments 'Voting' for  "No Need"=
==A "No" vote==
:Folks, like yourself apparently, are already putting synonyms into wiktionary. Which is good. There's no need for a separate namespace or project. --[[User:Eean|Eean]] 03:46, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)

==Another "No" vote==
I vote that the WikiSaurus concept is:
#An interesting exercise.
#Not needed.
#Represents loss of data that belongs '''in the articles themselves'''.
#Does not link definitions, it links words, which can be very misleading or worse, '''incorrect'''.
#Better suited by a bot that lists synonym/antonym ''referees'' that do not link back to the ''referer''.
#Better suited by a bot that lists synonym/antonym references.
--[[User:Connel MacKenzie|Connel MacKenzie]] 06:00, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)
*Response
**''Loss of Data'' - not one scrap of information has been lost, and plenty more added by the WikiSaurus entries. It has been reorganised. But, this is an electronic system, not a paper one, and some restructuring in this way is to be expected.--[[User:Richardb|Richardb]] 12:15, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)
**A thesaurus is about linking senses/meanings, not words or definitions.
**A Thesaurus addresses more than synonyms and antonyms, it addresses related senses, maybe nouns, adjectives, adverbs etc. Cannot see how you can get a bot to link senses/meanings at all.--[[User:Richardb|Richardb]] 12:15, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)
:::To rephrase what I said earlier (and you misunderstood):
:::This represents a loss of data '''from''' the article.
:::
:::Now, maybe I am just misunderstanding you or this solution.  Is the idea here to list wikisaurus entries in the synonyms and antonyms sections, instead of the synonyms and antonyms themselves?  
:::(Obviously, if you clarify that, then my other points are moot.  Each wikisaurus sense is linked by number to the definition sense it describes, just as synonyms now do, right?)  --[[User:Connel MacKenzie|Connel MacKenzie]] 20:15, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)
::::In general, I don't think I would remove the '''key''' synonyms and antonyms to put them into a WikiSaurus entry. I agree these should stay in the article. But, being a Wiki, even if I did remove them, I'm sure someone else with a different view would pu tthem back, and I wouldn't lose any sleep over that.
::::But, when the list of synonyms in an entry gets ridiculously long, like it was getting with "fuck" and it's synonyms, I think the list should be trimmed and replaced by a referral to the WikiSaurus entry. But again, it's a Wiki. If people don't like the trim, they'll put them back!

=Somewhere between "Yes" and "No"=
* The yes's give the N(N-1) argument, which is compelling, but misses the concept of the non-overlapping venn diagrams for related words. [[User:Eupedia|Eupedia]] 17:25, 2 May 2006 (UTC)
* The no's argue that the present system incorporates synonyms and related words already, but fail to solve the maintenance and completeness problem. [[User:Eupedia|Eupedia]] 17:25, 2 May 2006 (UTC)
==LSI software proposal==
I propose something in between, a software layer that allows: 
:a user to navigate the references in the syn/ant and related words sections using some kind of grouping heuristics such as latent semantic indexing (LSI), and; 

:an editor to immediately see the list of candidate related words (again using LSI, perhaps) and quickly select which ones he or she considers qualified to be listed in they syn, ant/ RW sections (which could be created automatically). [[User:Eupedia|Eupedia]] 17:25, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

==Severe improvements need to be made-PRhyu==

I agree that a thesaurus in Wikitionary would be very useful. However, there are certain flaws. for instance, when I looked at the list there were about fifty synonyms for "sexual intercourse," and no words were up which I really needed. I propse, therefore, that the people thoroughly limit words which are not needed and get on with words that are actually used! I mean, it's all very interesting to know that "sexual intercourse," can be replaced with "martial knowledge," but it's not useful in actual life, is it? Another thing. Wikisaurus is currently hosted as a sub-part of Wikitionary, and makes searchers actually find the word they want, and click it. Doubtless, later it will be very frustrating for searchers to find the word they want from hundreds, no, thousands, of words.And secondly, I suggest that Wikisaurus be merged within Wikitionary to let searchers instantly find the words they want instead of having to go to Wikisaurus then double back.

=Considerations of How to Implement=
==Maveric149==
All that means is that we would also have ==Synonyms== and ==Antonyms== sections in addition to the ==Translations== section. Peace.--[[User:Maveric149|Maveric149]]
The Thesaurus section is a great idea by doing it the way you have suggested, but the translation needs to be thought about. Needs a long discussion before we can decided how to do it. I suppose haveing a section is fine and if its not a perfect translation then explain why. etc -fonzy
==Dog Example -fonzy==
:The thesaurus stuff is more complicated than I thought since one word can have multiple definitions. Synonyms and antonyms will therefore need to be inline with the specific definitions. See [[dog]]. --mav

Hmmmm maybe something like

Dog - 

1)an animal thing

2)Name for a woman

<nowiki>===Thesaurus===</nowiki>

1)Canine,

2)Bitch

Hm, that just may work. --[[User:Maveric149|Maveric149]]

:Actually that might be a problem since words like [[dog]] can be both a noun and a verb (thus there would be two numbered lists). --mav

::The functional subsections should probably belong to each meaning/usage separately. --[[User:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]]

:::So would the [[dog]] example be a good one then? --mav


I did create a test page for an idea i have suggested before:[[Thesaurus:Dog]].

-fonzy

==Two different sections of wiktionary==
"Idea" maybe there can be 2 different sections of wiktionary, wiktionary.org/wiki/D:Dog for the dictionary, and wiktionary.org/wiki/T:Dog for the thesaurus.

==a thesaurus links between '''definitions''' - nichtich==
First of all a thesaurus links between '''definitions''' and not between words (as mentioned above). Secondly you should agree on the kind of relationships:
* Synonyms (''BTW there are very litte real synonyms - most of them are only similar'')
* Antonyms
* Upper terms/Narrower terms?
** Class/Instance?
* or just simple links (related terms) like in the examples?

'''Note:''' A thesaurus is much more than what you know from word processors! 

I suggest only two or three types of thesaurical links: 
* antonyms (<tt>'''not:'''<tt>)
* similar word (<tt>'''syn:'''</tt>)

Everything more is too complicated (see [[w:WordNet]]) and leads to a wikithesaurus which is not a wiktionary anymore.

==idiom dictionary==
As soon as the thesaurus contains two-word or longer phrases, it becomes almost impossible to distinguish this function from that of an [[w:idiom dictionary]].

The two functions should be considered together.  See discussion in [[Idiom_dictionary_considerations]], which could cross-fertilize well with this one.

==Wiktionary article per sense or synset - AxelBoldt==
I think it would be nice if Wiktionary were both a thesaurus and a dictionary, but the two are indeed quite different:
* a dictionary describes ''words'', complete with pronunciation, etymology and usage.
* a thesaurus describes ''senses'' (or ''synsets'' as [[w:WordNet]] calls them: sets of synonymous words). 
It seems like there should be one Wiktionary article per word (dictionary), and one Wiktionary article per sense or synset (thesaurus). Of course the dictionary page about a word would link to all its senses or synsets, as would the pages of all its synonyms. Translations to other languages seem to be more logically located at the sense (thesaurus) level rather than at the word (dictionary) level. At the thesaurus level, one could then also mention the various semantic relationships that WordNet recognizes, such as holonym, meronym etc. [[User:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]] 20:26 Jun 24, 2003 (UTC)

==14 different relationships on WordNet (Thesaurus, Schmesaurus)==

The [http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=19149&u=106258&m=5222&urllink=&afftrack=> Visual Thesaurus] is based on WordNet and it shows, I think, 14 different relationships including ''part of'', ''member of'', ''made of'' and other amazing connections that no thesaurus gives.  I just discovered that it '''does''' have compound terms as well, which I had thought WordNet omitted.

Try it on the word ''law'' and then pull it around and see all the connections, to police to Scotland Yard, to Newton.

Yes, you need to have BT, NT, RT, ''See'', and ''See also'' relationships and, yes, there is no such thing as true synonymy (even ''lawyer'' is not the same as ''attorney'' because you can be a lawyer but you need to have a client to be an ''attorney'') but for real power and usefulness in the coming Semantic Web, you want more than a dictionary, more then a thesaurus, you want an '''ontology'''.

==An idea towards a WikiSaurus, with experiment / examples - Richardb==
Can we have Wiktionary pages named like [[WikiSaurus:sexual intercourse]] where all the synonyms, anotnyms etc of Sexual Intercourse are listed (and boy are there a few!), instead of having to enter the Synonyms and Antonyms, and Relateds etc, in every word that is an Synonym of Sexual Intercourse.

Of course, there is a difficulty in  who decides which words are the KEY words, but can we get around that somehow ? We can always vote for deleting unnecessary duplicates--[[User:Richardb|Richardb]] 12:03, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)

==Wiktionary software needing to be overhauled - Blade Hirato==
:This essentially gets down to the Wiktionary software needing to be overhauled. I've been making a memorandum of all these ideas and their comments. I'll eventually get around to posting a Wiktionary RFC on Meta-Wiki for the future developers, if any. --[[User:Blade Hirato|Blade Hirato]] 09:29, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)

: Can't quite see how the software needs to be amended. Don't think an auto-generated Thesaurus is feasible, if that is what you were contemplating--[[User:Richardb|Richardb]] 07:02, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)

: It's probably been mentioned before, but I think the wiktionary needs more structure. Editing an entire article in one big text box works for wikipedia, but maybe the wiktionary should have a bunch of clearly defined sections to edit: Name, (noun/verb/etc), pronunciation, etymology, definition, adjectives, and translations. These would be edited from single-line text boxes, or something. Then, the search box on the left could have a bunch of search boxes, one for each of the sections, and you could do really effective searches: a verb, a synonym of this, with this in it's etymology. (But it would need a complete rebuilding of the search engine, and it might take a lot of computer resources. I don't know.) Users (or anyone, with cookies) could specify what sections they like to view (ex - need a thesaurus? Just close all the sections except for synonyms.) Like this, we wouldn't need a separate thesaurus, and everyone could customize their wiktionary as they like. --[[User:64.110.250.141|64.110.250.141]] 18:31, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)  (Sorry, this probably wasn't the best place to mention this...)

==Category implementation==

How about implementing this using categories?  This is just a bit of a brainstorm, and the words I've used as examples may be incorrect, but here's how it might work.  

In the entry for [[stiff]] (as an example) you might include <nowiki>[[category:headword:hardness]] and [[category:headword:corpse]]</nowiki> which would cause it to show up under both headwords.  These categories would be sub-categories within a hierarchy so that you could find information in a top-down approach too, however I would imagine the main use would be to look up a word and then look for synonyms/antonyms etc. from there.

In practice, I would suggest wrapping the category headings in a template, so you could use something like <nowiki>{{hw|hardness}}</nowiki> to produce something like this :
:''Use Wikisaurus to look up alternative words to '''stiff''' under the headword [[:category:headword:hardness|hardness]].''
I hope I've got the syntax right:
:<nowiki>:''Use Wikisaurus to look up alternative words to '''{{PAGENAME}}''' under the headword [[:category:headword:{{{1}}}|{{{1}}}]].''</nowiki>
:<nowiki>[[category:headword:{{{1}}}]]</nowiki>

The category page itself could include whatever other text is desirable (it should not be the definition of the headword however).  Possibly even a concise thesaurus-like listing of the related words.  Although this is duplication of the list that appears below it, this will make the entry easier to read, allow us to include words for which we don't currently have articles and let us break the list down by type of word (synonym, antonym etc).  The main purpose of the categorisation if this is the case would be to lead people to the headword article, rather than the creation of a list.

Alternatively a convention of using a piped category link to apply order could be adopted, e.g. <nowiki>[[category:headword:hardness|</nowiki>'''s'''<nowiki> stiff]] and [[category:headword:softness|</nowiki>'''a'''<nowiki> stiff]]</nowiki>, with '''s''' meaning synonym, and '''a''' meaning antonym, and with other letters for the other word types we want to include.  This would cause all synonyms to be listed together, in alphabetical order, under s, all antonyms under a, etc. It would not work so well if there are many items of each type, but if the lists are short then this could be an option.

I think there are various possible ways of implementing a thesaurus using categories which would need to be discussed, but that's just a few late-night ideas from the top of my head. Thoughts? --[[User:HappyDog|HappyDog]] 04:06, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)


It looks pretty useful, though perhaps a bit complex to catch on much. But I do worry about the overuse of categories. Having thousands of categories can make the category system unworkable/unusable.

I tried linking WikiSaurus entries to [[Appendix:Rogetâs thesaurus classification|Wiktionary:Roget Thesaurus Classification]]
. See [[WikiSaurus:mad person]] as an example.
--[[User:Richardb|Richardb]] 16:49, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)


:Actually, I would have thought simply adding '''<nowiki>{{hw|hardness}}</nowiki>''', or even '''<nowiki>{{hw|s hardness}}</nowiki>''' to an article is pretty easy!  Much easier than having to enter the full taxonomy, as is the case in your example.  Once the template is in place the casual user should be able to use it transparently.  The only complication is knowing which headword to place it under, but I imagine that will be a problem with all suggestions. --[[User:HappyDog|HappyDog]] 03:33, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)

The primary task of a thesaurus is to find the exact word you want, at least for me.  A paper thesaurus is typically organized using categories, with an alphabetical index.  If you know you're looking for a word like "formidable", you look it up in the aphabetical index, which refers you to a list of numbered categories, eg, "37: War".  And then you'd see formidable listed under the "adjectives" section of the category, that would list the adjectives relating to war.  The adjectives themselves would be grouped into sub-categories (37.1: Adjectives that describe the intensity of war; 37.2, adjectives that describe the attitudes of war; and so on, until 37.8, which would be adjectives that don't describe war, ie antonyms, such as "peaceful".  37.9 might be the first subcategory containing nouns.)  The categories are numbered in such a way that related words are more likely to appear in close proximity.  So, if the word I really wanted was "adamant", but the only thing I could remember was "formidable", the paper thesaurus is still a useful tool, because it's likely that adamant might appear in category 36 or 38.  I'm going into this horrible level of detail because I have never seen an online thesaurus, whether on the web or integrated into a word processor, that was as useful as a paper thesaurus.  Most online versions let you type in a word, and present you with either a single list of synonyms, or a list of categories that you can drill down into.  That's useless.  What you really want is to provide a huge list, filling the whole screen with related words.  By all means, break them down into categories and subcategories, but please display more than one such category on the page.  Using # anchors you can center the screen on the most relevant category and let the user scroll from there.  I particularly dislike the WordNet approach of finding words:  It presents you with a very small list of words and lets you "narrow" or "widen" or "find rhymes" and so on.  This doesn't work for me when I'm hunting for a word -- given such a hyperstructured thing to navigate, how do you find "adamant" starting from "formidable?"  Do you narrow or widen or what?   It's non-intuitive.  Whatever model you use to organize synonyms in Wiktionary, please look to the paper versions for their wisdom.  I personally would love to see an online thesaurus organized like the paper Bartlett's/Roget's, that displayed multiple categories containing hundreds of words near each other.  In this hypothetical system, clicking on a word would take you to its definition page.  To get a new list of words, you'd do a new Thesaurus search.  To this end, having a separate Wikisaurus seems like a good idea.  However, its current implementation doesn't work for me.  It's the Microsoft Word version of "enter a word and get a small list".  That's not very useful for a poet.

=Capturing Multiple Relations, but also Being Useful=

If we'd like a thesaurus that is both useful and new, something that isn't merely a copycat imitation of existing paper-based thesauruses, but really capitalizes on the greater flexibility we've got in an all-electronic design, I think we want to make sure we're broadly accommodating of all the various relationships between words, not just simple synonyms and antonyms, but certainly weak/related/suggestive sorta-synonyms, and then potentially all the funky meronyms and holonyms and the 14 other Wordnet relations, too.  But of course an important challenge will be make sure that the funky obscure relations don't obscure the familiar ones, to make sure that an unsophisticated reader  just looking for simple synonyms and antonyms won't be overwhelmed.

But there was an exremely important comment made a year ago by 216.38.149.153 pointing out that one big use (me, I'd even say ''the'' big use) of a thesaurus is finding that perfect word that you can't quite remember but that you know when you see it.  But as 216.38.149.153 pointed out, a too-logical, too-structured, too-mechanical system doesn't do that for you:

: "I have never seen an online thesaurus that was as useful as a paper thesaurus. Most online versions let you type in a word, and present you with either a single list of synonyms, or a list of categories  that you can drill down into. That's useless... It's the Microsoft Word version of "enter a word and get a small list". That's not very useful for a poet."

So we've got to capture those "near" and "similar" and "related" and "you might also be thinking of" relations as well.  There are several ways to approach this, I think:

#Make sure we've got "similar to" and "related to" and "you might also be thinking of" as relations.
#Make sure we're integrated with a Roget-like, concept-based, sense-and-meaning classification hierarchy, which is somehow also browsable.
#Do implement sets or lists of near-synonymous words (perhaps precisely what Wordnet calls "synsets"), but then work on ways of linking and grouping them.

With respect to #3, Roget does a ''lot'' of this.  For example, here's an entry picked somewhat at random:

: #740. Lenity.-- N. lenity, lenience, leniency; moderation &c. 174; tolerance, toleration; mildness, gentleness; favor, indulgence, indulgency; clemency, mercy, forbearance, quarter; compassion &c. 914.

Notice that there are a bunch of little lists there, with semicolons between them.  More importantly, notice the cross-references to other related entries.  When I use a paper-based thesaurus, I often find myself chasing those all over the place.  And they're obviously much easier to create and maintain -- not to mention to use! -- in a hyperlinked electronic format like this.

—[[User:Scs|Scs]] 05:13, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

: Here's a much more extensive example from Roget, showing a three-level internal hierarchy (comma, semicolon, full stop):

:: #837. Dejection. --
:: ...
:: Adj. cheerless, joyless, spiritless; uncheerful, uncheery[obs3]; unlively[obs3]; unhappy &c. 828; melancholy, dismal, somber, dark, gloomy, triste[Fr], clouded, murky, lowering, frowning, lugubrious, funereal, mournful, lamentable, dreadful.
:: dreary, flat; dull, dull as a beetle, dull as ditchwater[obs3]; depressing &c. v.
:: "melancholy as a gib cat"; oppressed with melancholy, a prey to melancholy; downcast, downhearted; down in the mouth, down in one's luck; heavy-hearted; in the dumps, down in the dumps, in the suds, in the sulks, in the doldrums; in doleful dumps, in bad humor; sullen; mumpish[obs3], dumpish, mopish[obs3], moping; moody, glum; sulky &c. (discontented) 832; out of sorts, out of humor, out of heart, out of spirits; ill at ease, low spirited, in low spirits, a cup too low; weary &c. 841; discouraged, disheartened; desponding; chapfallen[obs3], chopfallen[obs3], jaw fallen, crest fallen.
:: sad, pensive, penseroso[It], tristful[obs3]; dolesome[obs3], doleful; woebegone; lacrymose, lachrymose, in tears, melancholic, hypped[obs3], hypochondriacal, bilious, jaundiced, atrabilious[obs3], saturnine, splenetic; lackadaisical.
:: serious, sedate, staid, stayed; grave as a judge, grave as an undertaker, grave as a mustard pot; sober, sober as a judge, solemn, demure; grim; grim-faced, grim-visaged; rueful, wan, long-faced.
:: disconsolate; unconsolable, inconsolable; forlorn, comfortless, desolate, desole[Fr], sick at heart; soul sick, heart sick; au desespoir[Fr]; in despair &c. 859; lost.
:: overcome; broken down, borne down, bowed down; heartstricken &c (mental suffering) 828[obs3]; cut up, dashed, sunk; unnerved, unmanned; down fallen, downtrodden; broken-hearted; careworn.

==Another relation?==

Another sort of "relation" which might be captured, not applicable to all words but useful and interesting for those it does apply to, is position in and connection with neighbors along a spectrum.  I haven't seen a "-nym" term for this.  For example, two such spectra are freezing/cold/chilly/cool/neutral/tepid/warm/hot/scalding/incandescent and terrible/bad/lousy/poor/neutral/fair/middling/good/excellent. —[[User:Scs|Scs]] 05:53, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

That sounds like an excellent extension of WikiSaurus. This sort of extension to some extent validates using a new name, rather than just using the title thesaurus, as we can go much further than a usual Thesaurus, just as Wiktionary goes well beyond a normal dictionary.
I suggest "creating" a -nym word for this, to help us describe what is meant. If and when someone finds a real word to mean this, we can replace the occurrences of your made-up word with the real word. I've got some suggestions, but will leave to you the privilege of being creative about the word.--[[User:Richardb|Richardb]] 03:35, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

==Has WikiSaurus reached a scope above that of Thesaurus Considerations==
Whilst WikiSaurus is still as raw as can be, and controversial, has it already grown in scope above that of what might be termed "Simple" Thesaurus ? Should we call a close to this discussion of "Thesaurus considerations", and have a place (or group of places) discussing the scope, ongoing development and improvement of WikiSaurus ? In no-way would this pre-suppose how WikiSaurus should be implemented (the present method is still a somewhat controversial trial exploring the possibilities). I'm just looking at trying to rationalise, centralise, focus the discussion of what we are increasingly calling "The WikiSaurus", as opposed to talking about a Thesaurus and the WikiSaurus as two seprate conversations.--[[User:Richardb|Richardb]] 03:54, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

@ Wiktionary:License discussion
$ {{old discussion}}
At this early stage in the project, it is in principle still possible to change the license from GFDL to something else. 
I would favor releasing Wiktionary texts into the [[w:public domain|public domain]]. This way, the maze of slightly incompatible licenses out there is radically cleared, and the attribution requirements of the GFDL, which are not quite clear anyway, would be avoided. If every article is seen as a separate GFDL work, then the GFDL requires for instance that the title of any article be changed if the article is modified. On the other hand, if the whole Wiktionary is seen as a single GFDL work, then anybody who uses articles from it has to acknowledge the main contributors to Wiktionary. See [[w:GFDL|GFDL]].

Of course, releasing the texts into the public domain implies that anybody can do anything with them, including republishing under a restrictive license.

Is there any support for releasing Wiktionary texts into the public domain? 
[[User:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]] 22:41 Dec 14, 2002 (UTC) <br>
:I have no moral problems with this, but a large practical impediment is that Wikipeda is GFDL, which means we could not use text from Wikipedia on Wiktionary. That would be pretty silly. While GFDL is kind of inconvenient at times, it's not too bad. I don't think any similar licenses would allow "downgrading" to public domain anyway, so I don't see how any license incompatibilities would be resolved. -- [[User:Merphant|Merphant]]

::Since Wikipedia is not a dictionary, the issue of moving texts over shouldn't 
come up very often. The incompabilities are resolved for ''users'' of 
Wiktionary texts: they could use the information in any way they see fit. 
[[User:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]] 
:::Think of [[Wiktionary:pictures|pictures]]. --[[User:Brion VIBBER|Brion]]
 
: Personally I wouldn't object to releasing it under a more liberal license 
than the GFDL, but I don't think using PD would help that much. Maybe the GPL 
is a solution (which can be applied to non-programs if the source is clearly 
defined, which in our case it is) --[[User:Imran|Imran]] 23:45 Dec 14, 2002 
(UTC) 
Using copyleft licenses like the GPL and GFDL is a deliberate political act that forces those who would profit freely from our labors to allow others to continue to derive the same profit from their additions. If Wiktionary is to use a different license than GFDL, it '''must''' provide the same type of protections or I will have nothing more to do with it. (Using a different license, of course, will complicate sharing content with Wikipedia.) Ultimately it's up to Jimbo (and if it's ever created, the Wikipedia Foundation) if it's to remain linked to the Wikipedia project and server. --[[User:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]] 00:00 Dec 15, 2002 (UTC) <br>
I wouldn't contribute to a project knowing that somebody could steal and hijack my work and call it their own - as if I didn't exist or matter. The whole point of the GFDL is to ensure that text is ''free'' and will remain so ''forever''. 
Placing things into the public domain defeats this aim and worst, encourages others to fork our work instead of adding to it. --mav 
: Actually they can't, at least in the UK, a author has "moral rights" as well as "copyrights", and the moral rights include to right to be acknowledged as the author. (Although authors have to assert their moral right, while copyright is automatic). --[[User:Imran|Imran]] 00:18 Dec 15, 2002 (UTC)

:In the US, expressly placing something in the public domain denies the author of any control of the public domain item. No more rights whatsoever. --mav

::Not quite true. Public domain means that everyone has the ''same'' rights to ''use''  a work. It doesn't mean that someone can claim to have they written something they did not, or that they can edit a work and claim you did it. I can't legally take a copy of Hamlet, backspace Shakespear's name off it, and put my own on instead. -- [[User:Stephen Gilbert|Stephen Gilbert]] 01:04 Dec 21, 2002 (UTC) <br>
But it wouldn't be "stealing and hijacking" if you freely invite them to it :-) 
Philosophically, one could argue that information can't be owned and therefore 
can't be hijacked or stolen. 
Public domain works also "remain free forever"; it's just the changes that 
someone else adds to them that could become non-free. 
[[User:AxelBoldt|AxelBoldt]] 
:However it is possible for a commercial entity to make a CD version of it or 
mirror it on their site and apply a restrictive license to it. Or they could 
merge it with a dictionary they are selling. It is the GFDL that produces a 
sense of community and encourages contribution. I very much doubt that 
Wikipedia would have grown so much if it had been in the public domain. I'm 
strongly against PD. -- [[User:Arvindn|Arvindn]] 09:10 Dec 20, 2002 (UTC)

::Agreed. A copyleft license is like a constitution and bill of rights; it may 
not always seem expedient, but it's there to protect your freedoms against 
abuse. One should not toss either away lightly. --[[User:Brion VIBBER|Brion]]

The public domain also allows projects like Wiktionary to start with a base of 
words and definitions from public domain dictionaries, without having to wring 
our hands about license incompatibilities. 
:''I don't see what you mean here; isn't it true that we can put any license we 
want on material derived from a public domain source? The original versions are 
still public domain, but modifications made here under our license are 
protected by our copyright and license. --[[User:Brion VIBBER|Brion]] 01:34 Dec 
21, 2002 (UTC)'' 
Both copyleft and the public domain have their place. I believe a copyleft 
license is best for this project. The GFDL isn't the only game in town. There's 
also the [http://www.dsl.org/copyleft/dsl.txt Design Science License] and the 
[http://opencontent.org/openpub/ Open Publication License]. However, there's no 
compelling reason to use either of these over the GFDL, and they would make 
Wiktionary incompatible with Wikipedia. If we want to avoid the complexity of 
the GFDL, there's the option of using the new Creative Commons 
[http://www.creativecommons.org/license/ license selector]. For example, here's 
a [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/1.0-legalcode a simple copyleft 
license] that allows redistribution, modification and commercial use, while 
requiring attribution. -- [[User:Stephen Gilbert|Stephen Gilbert]] 01:04 Dec 
21, 2002 (UTC) -----

An alternative suggestion, use the GFDL but limit our copyright to say 10-20 
years, after all as things stand atm for practical purposes what we're 
developing now won't fall out of copyright for almost two centuries (probably 
around 2179 to be a bit more precise) by which time I expect most of us will be 
long long past caring what happens to Wiktionary. --[[User:Imran|Imran]]

:Not to worry, by then Microsoft-Sun-AOL-Time Warner-Apple will have bought the 
FSF and released a new version of the GFDL that allows them to reuse all GFDL'd 
material proprietarily without releasing it back to the community. Since all 
living human beings will be their employees, though, everyone will be free to 
use it as they wish. 
:Seriously, though; 'limiting our copyright' like that would mean that we can't 
import GFDL'd material from other sources, or the limit is contaminated and the 
exact provenance of each 20-year-old entry has to be researched by a future 
vulture to see if it's still protected. I don't think that's a practical 
solution; better to assume it's ''all'' protected and work to make that true. 
--[[User:Brion VIBBER|Brion]] 
:: Basically the only major sources of GFDL material are Wikipedia and FOLDOC, 
I don't think that we'll be using a significant amount from either of them. 
Including a term which releases it into the PD sometime into the future could 
be very useful if some flaw is found in the GFDL which stops development

::: ''Sure, and while we're raising specters of what could be, Congress 
'''could''' retroactively reassign copyright over all public domain material to 
the Disney Public Domain Repository Corporation. (We don't want to confuse 
people with all this legally copyable material! Keeping it around would require 
leaving copyable channels open, which is just one big loophole which evil 
hacker terrorist criminals can exploit to pillage poor helpless media 
corporations. Remember, Osama and Saddam LIKE it when you download warez, mp3z, 
and ripped DVDz!)'' 
:::: It's more likely then you think I've studied the GFDL in some depth at 
various times (for instance note the DTD section fails to require the 
Stylesheet to be GFDL and the lack of information on the handling of "fair use" 
material), the GFDL was designed for manuals and we're on dodgy grounds using 
it anyway, I'm happy enough using it for short term materials, but I think we 
need a get out clause in case a problem does come up. 
:: and it would also allow some else more freedom to take over if wiktionary 
fails. 
::: ''More freedom to not allow their new version to be copied freely? No 
thanks. We've already got non-free dictionaries.'' 
:::: To freely choose whatever license they want, be it free or non-free, if 
wiktionary fails I'd rather a non-free group took it over then no-one doing so 
and all of the effort we're putting in being wasted. If a Wiktionary survives 
then they have a twenty year head start, and bluntly if we can't in twenty 
years produce a better dictionary then someone who starts from the same point

What would be the legal implications of copying between a GPL work and a GFDL 
work? There is a rather complete Esperanto dictionary at 
[http://purl.org/NET/voko/revo/] with many translations into national 
languages, licensed under the GPL. -- [[User:AdamRaizen|AdamRaizen]] 14:18 Jul

It must be too late to respond, but I face the same issue though, honestly 
speaking, I hate getting involved in legal problems. I searched on the net and 
found the following article: [http://lwn.net/Articles/30787/ When "Free" Isn't 
Good Enough]. This says that the GFDL is incompatible with the GPL. Due to the 
license incompatibility, it is difficult to embed GFDL-ed stuffs in a GPL-ed 
program. But I'm not sure if we have a trouble with incorporating GPL-ed 
documents into GFDL-ed ones. --[[User:Nanshu|Nanshu]] 00:37, 2 Sep 2003 (UTC)

:Yes, those licenses are incompatible.

I want to make template articles based on Unicode's Unihan database. Does it 
conflict with the GFDL?

Dunno what the Gnu Free Document License involves or implies, and I don't really have the time to get involved. However, you might wish to be aware that http://open-dictionary.com/ seems to basically be cc of Wiktionary content with Google ads strapped on. I imagine, however, that you will object to his copyright notice at the very least. Handle as you see fit. -- Best wishes, Nils Jeppe [[User:212.202.51.23|212.202.51.23]] 00:12, 31 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:I am the developer of [http://open-dictionary.com/ Open Dictionary], and I find it disgusting that you label my efforts as a purposeful violation of the GNU FDL.

:If you consumed the same amount of time you placed in stating your 'copyright violation' note  (on this Wiki page) in viewing the Web site in general (frontpage, footers or term definition pages), you would notice I vividly label data sources correctly.

:On the frontpage, I explicitly declare:

:"Welcome to open dictionary, a collaborative project to produce a freely accessible multilingual dictionary in every language, with meanings, etymologies and pronunciations with the aid of the [http://open-dictionary.com/i/about_wiktionary.html Wiktionary] project."

:The text 'Wiktionary' is linked to a Web page explaining what Wiktionary is along with the following clear sentence:

:"The content available from and contributed to the Wiktionary project is covered by the [http://open-dictionary.com/Text_of_the_GNU_Free_Documentation_License_odw GNU Free Documentation License], which means that it is free and will remain so forever - please view the '[http://open-dictionary.com/i/content_license.html Legal notes]' Web page for additional details."

:Ignoring these informational textual pages, I also clearly label each generated Web page with a footer stating:

:"Copyright &copy; 2003-2004 [http://open-dictionary.com/i/contact.html Zeeshan Muhammad]. All rights reserved. [http://open-dictionary.com/i/content_license.html Legal notices]. Part of the [http://www.new-frontier.info/ New Frontier Information Network]."

:The text label 'Zeeshan Muhammad' links to a Web page allowing Web users to contact the Web site maintainers (me) - on this Web page, I explicitly attempt to assist users who want to know the license terms by stating:

:"If your enquiry addresses license issues regarding the information presented on open-dictionary.com, then you are advised to view our [http://open-dictionary.com/i/content_license.html legal notices] Web page."

:The legal notices' Web page contains rich license information which is human readable along with full license links to the GNU FDL and associated URLs.

:To further strengthen case that I attempted to follow the GNU FDL as carefully as possible (within technical coding boundaries), I also developed [http://users.open-dictionary.com/ users.open-dictionary.com] which states the contributors of Wiktionary

:Also, upon usage of Wiktionary content, I also made aware the Web user of the Wiki editing functions they had access to with the following clear textual statement:

:"Found an omission? You can freely contribute to this [http://open-dictionary.com/i/about_wiktionary.html Wiktionary] article."

:Next to this sentence was an edit button which directly went to the edit section of the content in question to allow the user to contribute to Wiktionary.

:With all of these clear signs, I cannot understand how you may label my efforts as purposeful violation of the GNU FDL.

Why is it that unlike the main commons, Wiktionaries do not require -- and at any rate don't display -- licensing information for picture/media uploads?  Is this intentional?  
:All the uploads are housed at Commons, so that's where the licensing information is kept.  We discourage local files, and prefer that everything (audio and graphic) be uploaded at Commons.  Clicking on the image will pull up the Commons page with the licensing info. --[[User:EncycloPetey|EncycloPetey]] 09:29, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

# A [[political]] [[philosophy]] [[opposed]] to the [[separation]] of a [[religious]] [[group]] ("[[church]]") and a [[government]] ("[[state]]"), especially the belief held by those in 19th [[century]] [[England]] [[opposed]] to separating the Anglican church from the [[civil]] government or to refer to separation of church and state. {{defdate|from 20th c.}}
#* '''1998''', University of Oklahoma College of Law, ''American Indian Law Review'':
#*: Jed Rubenfeld, who actually may not have been recycling a ''Boerne'' Court- rejected argument into a law review article,<sup>450</sup> reasoned that RFRA indeed lacked constitutionality, but because of First Amendment antidisestablishmentarianism, and not the reasons offered by the Court.<sup>451</sup>

#*: The establishmentarianism of Hatch's alliance-building strategy undermined by the disestablishmentarianism of Wiglesworth's treachery triggers an '''antidisestablishmentarianism''' in Hawk &mdash; but the negation of Wiglesworth's 'dis' coupled with the counter-negation of Hawk's 'anti' does not simply generate a synthetic affirmation of Hatch's 'establishmentarianism'. Instead, Hawk's '''antidisestablishmentarianism''', like a cancerous wart on the end of the nose, is perched at the fuzzy border separating [[ontology]] from [[oncology]], [[malignity]] from [[malignancy]].

@ portmanteau word
$ ==English==

===Etymology===
Coined by [[w:Lewis Carroll|Lewis Carroll]] in 1872, based on the concept of two words packed together, like a [[portmanteau]] (a travelling case having two halves joined by a hinge).
: 'Well, “[[slithy]]” means “[[lithe]] and [[slimy]].” “Lithe” is the same as “active”. You see it’s like a '''[[portmanteau]]'''–there are two meanings packed up into one word.'
''[[s:Through The Looking Glass (And What Alice Found There)|Through The Looking Glass]]'' ([[s:Through the Looking Glass (And What Alice Found There)/Chapter VI|Chapter VI. Humpty Dumpty]])

===Noun===
{{en-noun|head=[[portmanteau]] [[word]]}}

# {{linguistics}} A word which combines the meaning of two words (or, rarely, more than two words), formed by combining the words, usually, but not always, by adjoining the first part of one word and the last part of the other, the adjoining parts often having a common vowel; for example, ''[[smog]]'', formed from ''[[smoke]]'' and ''[[fog]]''.

==English==

===Usage notes===
Different Germanic senses of ''a-'' became confused – vaguely “intensive” – and are no longer productive. The Greek sense of “not” (e.g., {{term|amoral}}) remains productive.
: “[I]t naturally happened that all these ''a-'' prefixes were at length confusedly lumped together in idea, and the resultant ''a-'' looked upon as vaguely intensive, rhetorical, [[euphonic]] [nice-sounding], or even archaic, and wholly [[otiose]] [pointless].” OED.

===Etymology 1===
From {{etyl|enm}} {{term|a-||up, out, away|lang=enm}}, from {{etyl|ang}} {{term|a-|ā-|lang=ang}}, originally {{recons|ar-|lang=ang}}, {{recons|or-|lang=ang}}, from {{etyl|gem-pro|en}} {{recons|uz-||out-|lang=gem-pro}}, from {{etyl|ine-pro|en}} {{recons|uds-||up, out|lang=ine-pro}}.

===Etymology 1===
From {{etyl|la|it}} {{term|ad|ad-|lang=la}}.

====Prefix====
{{head|it|prefix}}

# {{l/en|ad-}} (indication direction)

====Usage notes====
The Italian prefix ''a-'' often reduplicates the following consonant ([[:w:en:Syntactic gemination|syntactic gemination]], [[w:it:Raddoppiamento fonosintattico|raddoppiamento fonosintattico]]).
The actual forms usually will be {{term|ab-|lang=it}} (in {{term|abbracciare|lang=it}}), {{term|ad-|lang=it}} (in {{term|addestrare|lang=it}}), {{term|al-|lang=it}} (in {{term|allargare|lang=it}}) etc.

----

==Navajo==

===Prefix===
{{head|nv|prefix}}

# [[someone]]'s, [[people]]'s

====Usage notes====
This prefix is often used as a neutral possessive pronoun to make the citation forms of [[inalienable]] nouns: {{term|amá|lang=nv||someone's mother}}, {{term|akʼos|lang=nv||someone's neck}}, {{term|ajáád|lang=nv||someone's leg}}, {{term|ajááʼ|lang=nv||someone's ear}}, {{term|akʼéí|lang=nv||someone's kin}}. The alternative is to use the prefix {{term|bi-|lang=nv||his/her/its/their}} to make these dictionary forms.

==Old English==

===Etymology===
From an earlier form {{term|ar-|lang=ang}}, from {{etyl|gem-pro|ang}} {{recons|uz-|lang=gem-pro}}. Cognate with {{etyl|goh|-}} {{term|ar-|lang=goh}}, {{term|ir-|lang=goh}} ({{etyl|de|-}} {{term|er-|lang=de}}).

===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|/ɑː/|lang=ang}}

===Prefix===

# forming words with the sense ''from'', ''away'', ''off'', ''out'', e.g. [[animan|āniman]]

==Old French==

===Etymology===
{{etyl|la|fro}} {{term|ad|lang=la}}, which was often reduced to {{term|a-|lang=la}} in compounds.

# {{non-gloss definition|indicating movement towards something}}

==Old Irish==

===Prefix===
{{head|sga|prefix|[[Appendix:Old Irish affixed pronouns|class A infixed pronoun]]}}

# [[him]] {{qualifier|triggers eclipsis}}
# [[it]] {{qualifier|triggers lenition}}

====Usage notes====
This form merges with the prefixes {{term|ro-|lang=sga}}, {{term|no-|lang=sga}}, {{term|di-|lang=sga}}, {{term|to-|lang=sga}}, {{term|fo-|lang=sga}}, {{term|ar-|lang=sga}}, and {{term|imm-|lang=sga}} to form ''ra-'', ''na-'', ''da-'', ''da-'', ''fa-'', ''ara-'', ''imma-'' respectively. It disappears after the particle {{term|ní||not|lang=sga}}, its only trace being the mutation it causes (eclipsis in the case of the masculine, lenition in the case of the neuter), thus ''ní cara'' {{gloss|does not love}} vs. ''ní chara'' {{gloss|does not love it}}, ''ní ben'' {{gloss|does not strike}} vs. ''ní mben'' {{gloss|does not strike him}}.

====Related terms====
* {{l/sga|d-}} {{qualifier|class B & C infixed pronoun}}
* {{l/sga|id-}}, {{l/sga|did-}} {{qualifier|class C infixed pronouns}}

===Verb===
{{en-verb|abash|es}}

# {{transitive}} To make [[ashamed]]; to [[embarrass]]; to [[destroy]] the [[self-possession]] of, as by exciting suddenly a [[consciousness]] of [[guilt]], [[mistake]], or [[inferiority]]; to [[disconcert]]; to [[discomfit]]. {{defdate|First attested from around (1150 to 1350).}}<ref name=SOED/>
#: "''He was a man whom no check could '''abash'''''." - [[w:Thomas Babington Macaulay|Thomas Babington Macaulay]].
# {{intransitive|obsolete}} To lose self-possession; to become ashamed. {{defdate|Attested from around (1350 to 1470) until the late 16<sup>th</sup> century.}}<ref name=SOED/>

====Usage notes====
* Of abash, [[confuse]], [[confound]]: '''Abash''' is a [[stronger]] word than '''confuse''', but not so strong as '''confound'''.
** We are ''abashed'' when struck either with sudden shame or with a [[humbling]] sense of inferiority; as, [[Peter]] was ''abashed'' by the look of his Master. So a [[modest]] youth is ''abashed'' in the presence of those who are greatly his superiors.
** We are ''confused'' when, from some [[unexpected]] or [[startling]] [[occurrence]], we lose [[clearness]] of thought and self-possession. Thus, a witness is often ''confused'' by a severe [[cross-]]examination; a [[timid]] person is apt to be ''confused'' in [[entering]] a room full of [[strangers]].
** We are ''confounded'' when our minds are [[overwhelmed]], as it were, by something wholly unexpected, [[amazing]], dreadful, etc., so that we have nothing to say. Thus, a criminal is usually ''confounded'' at the [[discovery]] of his guilt.
*::* Satan stood Awhile as mute, confounded what to say. - John Milton

|passage=The most persistent tormentor was Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who scored a hat-trick in last month’s corresponding fixture in Iceland. His '''ability''' to run at defences is instantly striking, but it is his clever use of possession that has persuaded some shrewd judges that he is an even better prospect than Theo Walcott. }}

====Usage notes====
* {{sense|skill or competence}} Usually used in the plural.
* Ability, capacity : these words come into comparison when applied to the higher intellectual powers.
** '''Ability''' has reference to the ''active'' exercise of our [[faculties]]. It implies not only native [[vigor]] of mind, but that ease and [[promptitude]] of execution which arise from mental [[training]]. Thus, we speak of the ''ability'' with which a book is written, an argument maintained, a negotiation carried on, etc. It always supposes something to be ''done'',<ref group="usage">George Crabb, 1826, ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=YEgSAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA13&lpg=PA13 English synonymes explained in alphabetical order]'', Collins & Hannay, p. 13</ref> and the power of ''doing'' it.
** '''Capacity''' has reference to the ''receptive'' powers. In its higher exercises it [[suppose]]s great [[quickness]] of [[apprehension]] and [[breadth]] of [[intellect]], with an uncommon [[aptitude]] for [[acquire|acquiring]] and [[retain]]ing knowledge. Hence it carries with it the idea of ''resources'' and [[undeveloped]] power. Thus we speak of the extraordinary ''capacity'' of such men as [[w:Francis Bacon|Lord Bacon]], [[w:Blaise Pascal|Blaise Pascal]], and [[w:Edmund Burke|Edmund Burke]]. "''Capacity''," says H. Taylor, "is [[requisite]] to [[devise]], and ''ability'' to [[execute]], a great enterprise."
* The word ''abilities'', in the plural, embraces both these qualities, and denotes high mental [[endowments]].

====Synonyms====

* {{sense|quality or state of being able}} [[capacity]], [[faculty]], [[capability]]
* {{sense|a skill or competence}} See [[Wikisaurus:skill]]
* {{sense|high level of skill or capability}} [[talent]], [[cleverness]], [[dexterity]], [[aptitude]]

These words have in common the idea of setting aside by some [[overruling]] act.
* ''Abolish'' [[applies]] particularly to things of a permanent nature, such as institutions, usages, customs, etc.; as, to ''abolish'' [[monopolies]], [[serfdom]], slavery. ''Repeal'' [[describes]] the act by which the legislature of a state sets aside a law which it had previously [[enacted]].
* ''Abrogate'' was originally applied to the [[repeal]] of a law by the Roman people; and hence, when the power of making laws was [[usurped]] by the [[emperors]], the term was applied to ''their'' act of setting aside the laws. Thus it came to express that act by which a sovereign or an [[executive]] government sets aside laws, [[ordinances]], [[regulations]], [[treaties]], [[conventions]], etc.
* ''Revoke'' denotes the act of [[recalling]] some previous grant which [[conferred]], privilege, etc.; as, to ''revoke'' a decree, to ''revoke'' a power of [[attorney]], a promise, etc. Thus, also, we speak of the ''revocation'' of the [[Edict]] of [[Nantes]].
* ''Annul'' is used in a more general sense, denoting simply to make void; as, to ''annul'' a contract, to ''annul'' an agreement.
* ''Nullify'' is an old word applied to the setting of things aside either by force or by total [[disregard]]; as, to ''nullify'' an act of Congress.
* ''Cancel'' is to strike out or annul, by a [[deliberate]] exercise of power, something which has [[operative]] force. -->

* It may also be the combination of three {{etyl|he}} words {{term|ארבע-אחד-ארבע|lang=he|sc=Hebr}} when it is read from right to left [http://www.scribd.com/doc/14656725/Abracadabra].
* The Aramaic is the source of the ''Avada Kedavra'' killing curse in the ''Harry Potter'' books.<!-- JK Rowling said this 15 April 2004, at the Edinburgh Book Festival, but referred to the meaning as “let the thing be destroyed”-->

====Usage notes====
Not all religions that revere Abraham are considered Abrahamic. The term always covers [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]], and often includes [[Bahá'í]]. Other faiths descended from these religions, such as [[Rastafari]] and [[Mandaeism]], are sometimes not described as Abrahamic even if they consider Abraham holy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/alt_mean1.htm|publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance|title=Meanings of ambiguous terms beginning with the letters "A" to "R"|accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref>

@ 大きい
$ ==Japanese==
{{ja-kanjitab|大}}
{{ja-see-also|大きな}}

===Etymology===
Appearing in the [[w:Muromachi_period|Muromachi period]] (1337 to 1573).

From older adjectival noun {{term|lang=ja|大き|tr=ōki}}, derived from attributive form ''ōki'' of cognate adjective ''ōshi'' (meaning both “large” or “many”, spelled as {{l|ja|多し}} or {{l|ja|大し}}, modern {{etyl|ja|-}} {{term|lang=ja|多い|tr=ōi||many}}), in turn derived from {{etyl|ojp|ja|sort=おおきい}} adjectival noun ''opo'' (“indistinct; of uncertain size, shape, or amount”; read as ''ō'' in modern {{etyl|ja|-}}, spelled as {{l|ja|凡}} or {{l|ja|大}}).

{{IPAchar|/opoki/}} > {{IPAchar|/oɸoki/}} > {{IPAchar|/owokiː/}} > {{IPAchar|/oːkiː/}}

===Pronunciation===
* {{l|ja|sc=Latn|訓読み|Kun'yomi}}
* {{IPA|lang=ja|[o̞ːkiː]}}

===Adjective===
{{ja-adj|kk|decl=i|hira=おおきい|hhira=おほきい|rom=ōkii}}

# [[big]]
# [[broad]], [[immense]]

====Inflection====
{{ja-i|大き|おおき|ōki}}

====Usage notes====
{{term|lang=ja|大きい|tr=ōkii}} and {{term|lang=ja|大きな|tr=ōkina}} are essentially the same word.  However, while ''ōkii'' can be used both attributively and to end a sentence, ''ōkina'' can only be used attributively, and must be followed by a noun or noun phrase.
* '''Correct grammar:'''
*: {{Jpan|あの車はおおきい。 / あの車はおおきいです。}} ― ''Ano kuruma wa ōkii. / Ano kuruma wa ōkii desu.'' ― That car is big.
* '''Incorrect grammar:'''
*: {{Jpan|あの車はおおきな。 / あの車は大きなです。}} ― *''Ano kuruma wa ōkina. / *Ano kuruma wa ōkina desu.'' ― *That car is a big __.
:: Since ''ōkina'' can only be used attributively, a noun '''must''' come after the word.

====Synonyms====
* {{l|ja|でかい|tr=''{{l|ja|sc=Latn|dekai}}''}}: [[huge]]

@ 犬
$ {{also|大|太}}
==Translingual==
{{stroke order|type=animate}}

===Alternative forms===
* {{l|ja|犭}} (when used as a left Chinese radical)

Although the alternative form clearly shows only three strokes, it is still counted as four strokes when using a Chinese dictionary. Compare [[氵]] from {{term|水||water|sc=Hani}}, [[扌]] from {{term|手||hand|sc=Hani}}, and [[忄]] from {{term|心||heart|sc=Hani}}, all of which are a 3-stroke form from a 4-stroke character.

===Etymology===
{{liushu|p}} – the dot is the ear. In the form {{Hani|[[犭]]}}, a dog that is up on its hind legs.

The character is considered a rather abstract rendition – [[w:Confucius|Confucius]] is quoted as saying “The ancients must have had very strange looking dogs” (500 {{B.C.E.}}).<ref>{{cite web

{{Han char|rn=94|rad=犬|as=00|sn=4|four=4303<sub>0</sub>|canj=[[戈]][[大]] (IK)|ids=⿻[[大]][[丶]]}}

# [[dog]]
# radical number 94

====Usage notes====
犬 is the 94th radical in the Chinese dictionary.  Compound characters such as [[狇]] mostly use the alternative form at the left of the character.  Most represent something to do with dogs or other animals. A smaller proportion (e. g. [[狀]]) use the primary form at the right of the character.  A few even show both forms: in [[獄]] which means "prison" or "litigation"; "words" ([[言]])  stand between two dogs to keep them from biting each other.

===Etymology===
From {{etyl|ojp|ja|sort=いぬ}}.  Derivation uncertain.  Various theories exist, including derivation from ancient verb {{term|lang=ja|往ぬ|tr=inu||to leave, to be gone}}, from the way a dog will guard the house while the master is away; from a compound of {{term|lang=ja|家|tr=ie||house, home}} + {{term|lang=ja|寝|tr=nu||to sleep|pos=ancient monosyllabic form of modern {{l|ja|寝る|tr=''neru''}}}}; from ancient Japanese {{term|lang=ja|狗|tr=enu||puppy, dog}}, itself of uncertain derivation; or as a borrowing from some other unknown language.

===Etymology===
[[File:Icelandic horse1.jpg|thumb|right|250px]]
{{liushu|p}}; derived from the pictogram of a horse with its head turned to look back and showing a flowing mane in the wind. The four short strokes at its base ([[灬]]) represent its feet, and the sweeping hook stroke in the lower right represents its tail.

Compare also {{term|鳥||bird|sc=Hani}}, whose current form is similar (graphically, [[灬]] for claws/legs).

Contrast with {{term|鹿||deer|sc=Hani}}, which saw a very different development, and {{term|𢊁||bison|sc=Hani}} (as in [[薦]]), which is a hybrid: it has the the legs of 馬 (灬) but the head of 鹿.

{{wikipedia|lang=ja}}
{{wikipedia|Horse}}
[[File:Nokota Horses cropped.jpg|thumb|250px|{{Jpan|馬}}]]
===Etymology 1===
From {{etyl|ojp|ja|sort=うま}}.  Recorded in the [[w:Nihon Shoki|Nihon Shoki]] as having been brought over from the Korean peninsula kingdom of [[w:Baekje|Baekje]], with the earlier reading of ''ma''.  The initial ''m'' sound was apparently emphasized, possibly similar to ''*mma'', becoming then ''uma'' or ''muma'', via processes also seen in the word {{term|lang=ja|梅|tr=ume, mume||plum}}.

The ''ma'' sound denoting "horse" is common to a number of languages of central Asia, where horses were first domesticated, suggesting a possible cognate root.  Compare {{etyl|mnc|-}} {{term|lang=mnc||morin|horse}}, {{etyl|mgt|-}} {{term|lang=mgt|морь|tr=morj||horse}}, {{etyl|ko|-}} {{term|lang=ko|말|tr=mal||horse}}, {{etyl|cmn|-}} {{term|lang=cmn|馬|tr=mă||horse}}, and Proto-Indo-European {{recons|mark(')-||horse|lang=ine-pro}} and descendants such as {{etyl|ga|-}} {{term|lang=ga|marc||horse|pos=archaic}} or {{etyl|en|-}} {{term|lang=en|mare||female horse}}.

====Pronunciation====

====Noun====

# a [[horse]]
# {{context|lang=ja|sort=うま|shogi}} a promoted [[bishop]]
# a [[sawhorse]]: a four-leg [[stand]] made of wood or iron for supporting other materials

===Etymology 2===
Shift from ''uma'' form, becoming more common starting from the [[w:Heian period|Heian Period]].  This change later reverted, and ''muma'' is now considered obsolete.

{{Hani-forms|国|[[國]]}}

===Etymology===
{{Han simp|國|f=或|t=玉}}

In this simplified form, this character consists of 玉, the Chinese character for [[jade]] (or precious stone or [[gem]]) (representing the emperor), enclosed by the character meaning "erect," "proud," or "upright".  In the Kangxi Dictionary of 1716 the character 国 is not included, but other characters like 囯, 囶 and 圀 are, as well as a character made up of three 秦.  國 is the original character.

====Usage notes====
The [[on'yomi]] is used in compounds like {{l|ja|国語}} (こくご, '''Koku'''go: "national language", i.e. [[Japanese]])  or {{l|ja|中国}} (ちゅうごく, Chū'''goku''': [[China]]; the [[Chūgoku]] region of central Japan). In many compounds where the {{Jpan|国}} character does not come first, ''koku'' changes to ''goku'' due to [[Appendix:Japanese_glossary#rendaku|rendaku]] ({{l|ja|連濁}}).

==English==

===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|/kwɪz/}}, {{X-SAMPA|/kwIz/}}
* {{rhymes|ɪz}}

===Etymology===
The true etymology is unknown. 
{{rel-top|proposed etymologies:}}
* (1790) Originally applied to a popular toy, from a dialectal variant of {{term|whiz|lang=en}}.
* Reputed without evidence to have been invented by a late 18th century Dublin theatre proprietor who [[bet]] he could add a new nonsense [[word]] to the English language. He thus had the word painted on walls all over the city. The morning after, everyone was talking about the new word.
* The original meaning is [[interrogation]] (1867), being derived from the verb. Current meaning only since 1941.
* The meaning "hoax" is the original (1796), shifting to the meaning "interrogate" (1847) under the influence of '''to [[question]]''' and '''[[inquisitive]]'''.
* Originally ''quies'' (1847), may have derived from Latin ''qui es?'' (who are you?), traditionally the first question in [[oral]] Latin [[exam]]s. Used as a noun from 1867, spelling quiz first recorded in 1886.

# [[autumn]], [[fall]]

====Usage notes====
The made-up compound noun {{term||herfstschrik|fear of Autumn}} ({{IPA|/hɛrfstsxrɪk/|lang=nl}}, {{X-SAMPA|/hErfstsxrIk/}}) is used to demonstrate the bewildering number of consonants that can be strung together in Dutch. It is not particularly difficult for a speaker of Dutch to pronounce all consonants, but in practice a few of these will be dropped to something like {{IPA|/hɛrfsxrɪk/|lang=nl}}, {{X-SAMPA|/hErfsxrIk/}}.

# {{idiomatic}} A person who spends excessive amounts of time using a [[computer]].
#* '''1994''' - Ruth Shurman - ''Me and my Gizmo: No. 8'' in ''The Guardian'' (14 July 1994)
#*: Lady Miss Kier is a '''mouse potato'''. 'I wake up, I go and turn the computer on before I wash my face or brush my teeth. I'll be sitting there in my underwear, and before I know it, four hours have passed. Then I pick up the phone, push some more buttons and the food delivery arrives, and then 16 hours have passed in front of the computer. It leaves you completely drained.'
#* '''2001''' - Aniruddho Sanyal - ''The Trini Trinity Is Found On De Line'' in ''The Times Higher Education Supplement'' (7th December 2001)
#*: The internet, the authors say, affords the average '''mouse-potato''' the opportunity to experience a Naipaul-esque enigma of arrival in far-away lands without ever leaving the shores of Trinidad.

===Alternative forms===
* [[to-day]] {{qualifier|archaic}}

===Etymology===
Via {{etyl|enm|en}}, from {{etyl|ang|en}} {{term|sc=unicode|todæge|tōdæge|lang=ang}}, {{term||tō dæge||on [the] day|lang=ang}}, made from {{term||tō||at, on|lang=ang}} + {{term||dæge|lang=ang}}, the dative of {{term|dæg|sc=unicode|lang=ang||day}}.
* The first component [''to-''] is from {{etyl|enm|-}}, from {{etyl|ang|-}} {{term|tō||towards, for the purpose of|lang=ang}}, from West Germanic {{recons|to}}, from {{etyl|ine-pro|en}} {{recons|do-||to, toward, upward|lang=ine-pro}}.
* The second component [''-day''] is from {{etyl|enm|-}}, from {{etyl|ang|-}} {{term|dæg|lang=ang|sc=unicode}}, from {{etyl|gem-pro|en}} {{recons|dagaz|lang=gem-pro}}, from {{etyl|ine-pro|en}} {{recons|dʰegʷʰ-||to burn|lang=ine-pro}}. It is not related to Latin {{term|dies|lang=la}} (which is from [[Proto-Indo-European]] base {{recons|dyeu-||to shine|lang=ine-pro}}), but rather to {{etyl|sa}} {{term|sc=Deva|दाह|tr=dāha||heat|lang=sa}}, which came from {{etyl|ine-pro|en}} {{recons|dʰegʷʰ-||to burn|lang=ine-pro}}.
* Thus, '''''today''''' and '''''day''''' are not related to {{etyl|la|-}} {{term|dies|diēs|lang=la}}, but instead to {{term|fever|lang=en}}.

===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|/təˈdeɪ/}}
* {{audio|en-us-today.ogg|Audio (US)}}
* {{audio|En-uk-today.ogg|Audio (UK)}}
* {{rhymes|eɪ}}

===Adverb===
{{en-adv|-}}

# on the current [[day]] or [[date]]
#: ''I want this done '''today'''.''
#: '''''Today''', my brother went to the shops.''
# in the current [[era]]; [[nowadays]]
#: ''In the 1500s, people had to do things by hand, but '''today''' we have electric can openers.''

== IPA of दुःख ==

The IPA for the Hindi [[दुःख]] is [d̪ʊhkʰ], but [ʊ] is not a Hindi sound found on [[Appendix:Hindi_pronunciation]]. I don't know anything about Hindi. Is there a reason for this? --[[User:BenjaminBarrett12|BB12]] ([[User talk:BenjaminBarrett12|talk]]) 08:46, 2 January 2013 (UTC)
:You would be better off looking at [[WT:HI TR]] or [[w:Hindi-Urdu phonology]]. There's a conspicuous lack of native speakers on both of the Wiktionary treatments, but I would trust Ric Laurent's judgement over JackPotte's hands down. I suspect that there's a reason the appendix uses slashes instead of square brackets- it allows for more vagueness about the actual sounds. Some of it may have to do with averaging out dialectal variation, but it might also be along the lines of the use of u and o for transliterating Japanese: it's close enough for practical purposes because it's unambiguous, but you would need to hear a native speaker to get it right. Not that I have any experience with spoken Hindi myself, so don't take my word for anything... [[User:Chuck Entz|Chuck Entz]] ([[User talk:Chuck Entz|talk]]) 10:01, 2 January 2013 (UTC)
:: Thank you for the information. I'd like to know what the actual pronunciation is just for my own trivial satisfaction, but in general, it would be nice to make the issues clear on the Hindi pronunciation page. --[[User:BenjaminBarrett12|BB12]] ([[User talk:BenjaminBarrett12|talk]]) 19:04, 2 January 2013 (UTC)
::: The source (Ohala 1999 - a professional linguist and, I think, a native speaker) listed at [[w:Hindi-Urdu phonology]] gives /ʊ/ (and /ɪ/), so I would prefer those transcriptions to /u/ and /i/. —[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] 19:49, 2 January 2013 (UTC)

== [[reojo]] ==

I don't know how to format [[reojo]] - it is only used in the phrase [[de reojo]]. It looks like a noun, but it isn't a noun, just has a nouny feel to it. What heading do we need?

On the Main Page, we have "ekyúma" as our FOTW today.

== <s>[[proactive]]</s> ==

This has only one sense, which is labelled "proscribed". So is there a "normal" sense? If so, what is it?

I think the word has some very legitimate uses. Working in IT, I'm familiar with the distinction between "reactive support" (customer reports product is broken, you help them fix it) and "proactive support" (you remotely monitor the customer's system, hoping to catch failures before they occur). This is a useful distinction, and the pair of words reactive/proactive describes it well. Another pair of words which does the same thing is corrective/preventive, but I'm not sure how that pairing is better than reactive/proactive - it is longer. Sure, maybe some business folks overuse the word "proactive", but not all use in business is overuse. [[User:SJK|SJK]] ([[User talk:SJK|talk]]) 01:10, 13 January 2013 (UTC)

== [[academia]] - additional sense ==

I added what I believe is a valid additional sense: "Continuous study at higher education institutions; scholarship." I put the example sentence of: "Not every university graduate wishes to pursue academia." IMO this is quite different to the "academic community" sense given in the original entry. However, I don't think I worded the sense very well. What do you think? [[User:Tooironic|---&#62; Tooironic]] ([[User talk:Tooironic|talk]]) 05:55, 7 January 2013 (UTC)

== change furniture ? ==
How does one describe in English the act of moving pieces of furniture around in an apartment (e.g., to find a better or more pleasant arrangement) -- to ''change the place(s) of the furniture''? to ''swap (pieces of) furniture''? to ''rearrange the furniture?'' something else?

: I would usually use ''rearrange the furniture'' or (simply) ''move the furniture''. ''I swapped the sofa and the armchair around'' seems right to me also - unlike the other two, it strongly implies that the sofa is now where the armchair was and vice versa.

: Simply put: grammatical gender isn't a universal. It's developed in a few major language families such as [[Indo-European]] and [[Afro-Asiatic]], and has been borrowed into a few other languages, but I would suspect that most language families never had it. It's generally not a good idea to make value judgments based on linguistic characteristics- many of the most virulently sexist cultures throughout history have spoken languages without grammatical gender.

::: I wouldn't say that the Bantu languages have no gender in the loose sense. Gender in Indo-European is based on a distinction in animacy, and the Bantu noun classes have that distinction too but extend it further. Grammatically, Bantu noun classes are not so different from Indo-European genders. And if you look even more broadly, the noun classifiers used when counting objects in Chinese resemble noun classes, too. As English speakers who are in contact primarily with other Indo-European languages, we naturally tend to think of gender as an obvious way to divide nouns up, but if you look around the world's languages it's really much more common to divide nouns up in ''some'' way. If you look for gender alone then it seems almost Euro-centric. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 00:08, 11 January 2013 (UTC)
:::: Perhaps I should have said "sex-based grammatical gender". Indo-European languages are very strong in influence and sheer numbers of speakers, so we tend to take it for granted that certain linguistic features are universal, when they're anything but. Another example is our system of past, present and future tenses, which isn't even universal within Indo-European. The norm seems to be systems based on things like completed and incomplete action. As with grammatical gender, it doesn't mean that such things can't be described in languages without a given feature, just that they have to be expressed in other ways.

not sure this is the correct place for my question, first time i want to comment on a Wiktionary entry. please let me know if inappropriate, and sorry in advance then. 
what i stumbled upon:
http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/passenger_kilometer defines passenger kilometers as the result of dividing total distance traveled by the number of passengers. shouldn't this rather be the result of multiplying total distance traveled with the number of passengers?
seldomuser {{unsigned}}
: Thanks for bring it up.
: The quantity is tabulated as the sum of the distances traveled by some defined group of passengers (eg, on a given airline for a given month). For a given transportation vehicle carrying N passengers for M miles on a given [[stage]] of a flight, the number could be calculated as N times M. As a definition: "''(transportation)'' A kilometer traveled by a passenger, as on an airline."

== [[grab]] ==

Entry claims that grabbing something is consuming it (grab a sandwich, grab a coffee). I disagree: grabbing is the act of hastily picking it up. You could grab a sandwich and then not have time to eat it, right? [[User:Equinox|Equinox]] [[User_talk:Equinox|◑]] 23:53, 10 January 2013 (UTC)
: It is certainly often used with the implication of eating something. I'm not sure if that counts. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 23:56, 10 January 2013 (UTC)
:: I kinda agree with Equinox. I see it as meaning the same thing as "get". Of course, your intention is to eat it, but one doesn't use "grab" = "eat" once it is gotten. [[User:Leasnam|Leasnam]] ([[User talk:Leasnam|talk]]) 00:06, 11 January 2013 (UTC)
::: So do I. Of course if you grab a sandwich, you usually ''intend'' to eat it, but that's part of real-world knowledge, not part of the semantics of "grab". —[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] 00:12, 11 January 2013 (UTC)
::::The entry does reflect a difference in meaning between ''I picked up a sandwich'' and ''I grabbed a sandwich''. For the latter it would be very surprising to continue ''but I didn't have a chance to eat it'', but for the former not really surprising. I think it comes from the idea of the affair being so hurried that there is no chance for an interruption. [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  00:31, 11 January 2013 (UTC)
:::::It seems like a US/UK difference: COCA has 75 instances of "[grab] a bite" (450MM words); BNC 3 (100MM), making it 6 times more frequent in US, despite BNC having a lot more transcribed informal speech. [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  00:36, 11 January 2013 (UTC)
:::::: There may be a way to tell the difference. Are there any references to any kind of food that you can't physically grab, because they're liquid? Can you grab some water for example, or soup? {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 00:54, 11 January 2013 (UTC)
: As I understand it, it’s something like “to fetch or obtain something hastily”. For example, you can tell someone “grab your cellphone before leaving”.  — ''[[User:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|Ungoliant]] <sup>([[User Talk:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|Falai]])</sup>'' 02:44, 11 January 2013 (UTC)
::Yes, that's a normal, more or less literal meaning, though the must literal one is "take or seize (something) with a rapid motion of one's hand". But the extended meanings include that in "grab someone's attention". With respect to prepared, ready-to-eat food, it seems to imply that the food is not just grasped or obtained, but actually consumed. MWOnline has this as "take hastily" and uses "grab a bite" and "grab a cab" as usage examples. One can also find "grab a train/ride/plane" at bgc. 
::About other terms that are of prepared food: "grab some takeout" does not imply that the food was eaten without delay, ie, as soon as one got in the car or outside. Perhaps the completion is implied not in the verb but in the particular term: "bite", "snack", "meal". "Sandwich" and "coffee" are more ambiguous, like "pizza" etc. 
::I think the event structure (completion vs first step in a sequence) is not inherent in the verb, but rather in at least the complete predicate if not more of the context. I don't think we should have the definition that bothered Equinox. [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  04:17, 11 January 2013 (UTC)
::: The cellphone example is pertinent. If grabbing a sandwich implies eating it, grabbing a cellphone could imply making a call on it! "I grabbed my cellphone and told my boss I wouldn't be coming in." [[User:Equinox|Equinox]] [[User_talk:Equinox|◑]] 13:38, 11 January 2013 (UTC)
::::There is a difference. Compare "grab a cellphone ''and'' make a call" with *"grab a meal and eat it".

::::: I can easily imagine a conversation like this: A: "Are you hungry?" B: "No, I grabbed a sandwich on the way over." This works for "thirsty" and "water" as well. It doesn't work with cellphone, though: A: "Did you call her?" *"Yes, I grabbed my cellphone on the way over." --[[User:BenjaminBarrett12|BB12]] ([[User talk:BenjaminBarrett12|talk]]) 17:14, 11 January 2013 (UTC)
:What about the expression "I grabbed a shower"? That doesn't seem to be covered by any of our senses of [[[[grab]]]]. Or is it just an extension of the metaphor in [[[[take a shower]]]]? The fact that that's a red link suggests it's regarded as SOP, but none of our sense of [[[[take]]]] seems to cover it either. Anyway, not to stray too far from the point, I still maintain that "I grabbed a sandwich but then I didn't get a chance to eat it" is potentially a semantically felicitous sentence and that "consume" is at best part of the ''connotation'' of this meaning of "grab" but not part of its ''denotation''. —[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] 17:35, 11 January 2013 (UTC)

:: I once got a big laugh from a coworker when he said "I think I'll go grab a sandwich", and I replied "you might as well go ahead and eat it, too".

:::Leasnam's idea might be OK, but "quickly" is essential, IMO, for the sense that involves consumption or use. But note that it would be impossible to specify all of the encoding information required for someone to use the sense properly within the customary length of a dictionary definition. In contrast, Leasnam's suggestion is adequate for helping someone decode the usage. [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  14:12, 12 January 2013 (UTC)

::: Yeah. Looking around, I see we make a distinction between proper noun and common noun "Christmas" and PN and CN "Schrödinger's cat", we sort-of distinguish PN and CN "English" (CN: "One's ability to employ the English language", "The English-language term or expression for something" and PN: "The language originating in England"), we don't distinguish PN from CN "German" ("we spoke mutually unintelligible Germans", "we spoke German") nor, as CodeCat points out, PN from CN "Sarah".

::::::EP spoke against plurals of "Proper nouns" and carried the day, AFAICR. Given names and surnames can be and are routinely pluralized. Arguably the are thereby usually not being used as proper names, though in the US the ''Kennedys'', for example, clearly refers to the US political family and arguably ''is'' a proper noun in such use. Personally, I am not at all sure that it has been a good idea to try to maintain a distinction other than an orthographic one between nouns used as or as part of proper names and other nouns.

== The word "fannot" ==

Hello from Denmark.
I Have problems with the word "fannot".
What is "fannot"
We are a group people who are searching for HMS Belette.
''she went aground on a sunken rock called "John" (or "Fannot") off''


: It appears to be a person's name, presumably a surname.<br>For reference, the information is cited at [[w:HMS Belette (1806)]] and [[w:Johns Rock]], crediting Gossett, William Patrick (1986) ''The lost ships of the Royal Navy, 1793-1900'', (London:Mansell), ISBN 0-7201-1816-6 and Hepper, David J.

I know all the old UK Marine litteratur where "Belette" is mentioned.
I also know the exsact position of "Johns" knot, mentioned in the danish pilot.
But it makes no sense to me at all.
The problem i the word "fannot", there has to be a meaning with that word.

Sorry for my bad english.

== tag (in) ==

== [[sennight]] ==
Should this word be obsolete/archaic/dated? We could compare it to the closely related term [[fortnight]], which is rarely used in North America, but still in common use in much of the Commonwealth.

== [[rebar]] ==

The entry has two senses:
#(countable) A steel reinforcing bar in a reinforced concrete structure.
#(uncountable) A grid-shaped system of such bars.

This doesn't match the usage I'm familiar with. I've always heard people treating "rebar" as an uncountable mass noun, referring to a single bar as "a piece of rebar" (There's a already a citation that reflects this usage). A quick check shows usage of "rebars", so we do need both countable and uncountable, but I'm skeptical that being in a "grid-shaped system" would make the difference between the two. You'll notice, also, that both senses refer to rebar(s) ''in concrete''. Are we to believe that no one uses the term until the concrete has been poured? I somehow doubt that we have a [[sheep]]-vs.-[[mutton]] type of distinction at play here, especially since suppliers advertise rebar all the time along with other raw materials like cement and lumber.

I'm not quite sure how to structure the entry, though. It seems like the mass-noun usage I'm familiar with could be pluralized when one is talking about different ''types'' of rebar, but that would be different than the countable sense of more than one ''piece''. I'm also not sure if the two overlap- would it be possible for a someone to ask: "could you go to that stack of rebar over there and bring me a couple of rebars?" [[User:Chuck Entz|Chuck Entz]] ([[User talk:Chuck Entz|talk]]) 06:48, 22 January 2013 (UTC)
:The "type of reinforcing bar" sense could be considered to apply to any mass noun, so we ''could'' dispense with it. Otherwise I agree with your assessment of the usage. I might even want to verify the second sense given. I think we do need indicate both countability and uncountability. We could split the uncountable and uncountable usage double the number of definitions or we could reword, indicate that both countability and uncountability apply, and have usage examples (not citations, IMO) for each sense illustrating countable and uncountable usage. An example of the combined approach:
:# ''(countable, uncountable)'' Reinforcement in the form of steel bars typically used in a grid arrangement <u>for</u> concrete structures.
:#: '''''Rebars''' are available in various lengths and diameters.''
:#: ''We're going to need a lot more '''rebar''' for a taller retaining wall.''
:#: ''Electric arc furnaces produce most of the tonnage of '''rebar'''.''
: Especially if the second existing sense is not verified, it would not be a waste of bytes to split the definition into countable and uncountable senses, though it may not be easy. [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  12:48, 22 January 2013 (UTC)

== [[que#French]] ==

French-speakers! Lend me your ears. I just added a new sense of {{term|que}}, one which has always confused me slightly. I put together the following definition, which might perhaps be improved if anyone knows more about this construction:
# {{non-gloss definition|Links two noun phrases in apposition forming a clause without a (finite) verb, such that the complement acts as predicate.}}

With the following examples:

*'''1874''', {{w|Barbey d'Aurevilly}}, ‘Le Bonheur dans le crime’, ''Les Diaboliques'':
*:—Quelle grande bête, avec tout son esprit, '''que''' votre marquise, pour vous avoir dit pareille chose! — fit la duchesse […].
*::''‘What a beast your marquess is, for all her spirit, for having told you such a thing!’ said the duchess.''
*'''1918''', {{w|Jean Giradoux}}, ''Simon le pathétique'':
*:—Quelle belle fleur '''que''' la rose! dit-elle soudain, alors qu'aucune rose n'était en vue […]. 
*::''‘What a beautiful flower the rose is!’ she said suddenly, though no rose was in sight.''

I've just moved house and all my best grammar books are still in boxes, so in the meantime, can anyone comment on this ‘appositive que’? Does it have a name?  Should it be marked ''dated'' (I associate it with 19th-century literature)? Is the definition more or less right? Is it connected in some way with the final ''que'' in phrases like ''qu'est-ce que c'est '''que''' ça?, qu'est-ce que c'est '''que''' ce bordel'' etc.? <span class="latinx" >[[User:Widsith|Ƿidsiþ]]</span> 09:21, 22 January 2013 (UTC)

:::Re: ''C'était une hypocrite de premier ordre que cette comtesse'': As with your first two examples, I think the closest English translation is to map the ''que'' to a comma: "She's a first-rate hypocrite, that countess!" (Funnily enough, there are some dialects or registers of English where people use ''is'' this way, à la "She's a hypocrite of the highest order, is that countess!" — see e.g. {{google|"she's a tall one is"}} — but for sociolinguistic reasons, I don't think that's a viable translation of this use of French ''que''.) —[[User: Ruakh |Ruakh]]<sub ><small ><i >[[User talk: Ruakh |TALK]]</i ></small ></sub > 06:53, 1 February 2013 (UTC)

According to [http://w3.erss.univ-tlse2.fr/textes/publications/CarnetsGrammaire/carnGram11.pdf Magali Rouquier], the ''que'' marks a topic rather than a predicate.
# ''La rose est une belle fleur.'' (a simple proposition)
# ''La rose, c’est une belle fleur.'' (definition by ''[[ce]]'' with a left dislocation)
# ''C’est une belle fleur '''que''' la rose.'' (anti-dislocation: reintegration of the topic into the phrase)
It is therefore best translated to a comma in English, as Ruakh has already said.

#:Well, not so fast. French also has ''C'est une belle fleur, la rose'', exactly as in English, and this is actually a very natural way of saying it in spoken modern French. Whereas using {{term|que}} sounds decidedly literary.

== Is ''star'' an adjective? ==

As you know, there's a hilariously large dispute on Wikipedia over the title of the film which I shall render in all lowercase and with no punctuation as "star trek into darkness". Among the few interesting things to come out of this dispute is the claim that, in the title, ''star'' is an adjective, ''trek'' is a verb, and ''trek into darkness'' is a noun phrase. The second and third notions are obviously erroneous and contradictory (and the second notion is furthermore incompatible with the first outside journalese), but the first is backed up by a few other dictionaries. However, those other dictionaries' examples of ‘adjectival’ ''star'' are of the form "star reporter", exactly the sort of thing we consider a noun+noun compound: [[[[star]]]] gives "star pupil" as an example of the noun sense "exceptionally talented person", which I've just expanded to "exceptionally talented or famous person". I'm curious: can anyone find uses of ''star'' as an actual adjective? See [[Wiktionary:English adjectives]] for some tests of adjectivity. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 18:25, 4 February 2013 (UTC)
:In Wiktionary parlance, I'm fairly sure that would be a case for {{temp|attributive}}, no matter the analysis. [[User:Circeus|Circeus]] ([[User talk:Circeus|talk]]) 18:56, 4 February 2013 (UTC)
:It is the American dictionaries (MWOnline, RHU, and AHD) that each have two senses of ''star'' shown as adjectives. The two senses of ''star'' as adjective at MWOnline do not include one suitable for the title, of course. Their adjective sense do not include all the noun senses which are found in attributive use of ''star'', so one is left to wonder whether they have found some true adjective uses or just include those two senses as adjectives to avoid the naive claim of incompleteness for not having them. I am not familiar with any use of ''star'' that would meet our syntax-based criteria for inclusion as an adjective. I looked at 300 bgc hits for "more|very|too star" and found none that showed ''star'' being used as a true adjective.
:OTOH, I could ''imagine'' such use and would not be shocked to find it, at least not in fairly small numbers, especially in a sense related to sports and entertainment.

::# Strong forms can often be used without anything (articles, pronouns, etc.) in front, especially as titles (Neues Deutschland - a former [[GDR]] newspaper, now a socialist newspaper in Germany).
::# Showing weak forms with definite articles (der letzte, die letzte, das letzte) is not always the best option as the article could be replaced with other words (e.g. dieser letzte, jener letzte, etc.) or there could be something between the article and the adjective - die junge deutsche Frau.

So it's consensus to use the masculine (strong) form as a lemma form for non-predicatively used adjectives (e.g. {{term|letzter|lang=de}})? (Another option would be to use the neutral {{term|letztes|lang=de}}, but I don't really have a strong opinion about it. I do have a very strong opinion about {{term|Drittes Reich|lang=de}} and {{term|Großer Bär|lang=de}} to be the correct lemma form ({{term|Dritte Reich|lang=de}} and the like is utter nonsense). As for nominalized adjectives, such as {{term|Deutscher|lang=de}} (meaning the people) and {{term|Arbeitspflichtiger|lang=de}}, I agree to use the strong forms, so the lemma form of the word for a male German would be {{term|Deutscher|lang=de}}, for a female German {{term|Deutsche|lang=de}}, and the plural form of both should also be included at {{term|Deutsche|lang=de}} rather than at {{term|Deutschen|lang=de}} (because this is the weak form that's only used with the definite article). The problem about those nominalized adjectives is that there isn't ''the'' genitive form we can put in the headword template. I agree with Atitarev in that we need inflection tables for those. [[User:Longtrend|Longtrend]] ([[User talk:Longtrend|talk]]) 12:18, 9 February 2013 (UTC)
: Do nominalized adjectives inflect any differently from the adjectives themselves (other than the capital letter)? Like, do they have predicate forms, mixed and weak forms? If so, then we could probably just re-use the adjective templates. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 14:02, 9 February 2013 (UTC)
:: The only difference is that the nominalized adjectives generally only have one gender (or two if they refer to human beings), not all three. So a man can be an {{term|Arbeitspflichtiger|lang=de}} and a woman can be an {{term|Arbeitspflichtige|lang=de}}, but no one is an {{term|Arbeitspflichtiges|lang=de}}. I'm actually having trouble thinking of a nominalized adjective that doesn't refer to a human being, but there are probably some. —[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] 14:19, 9 February 2013 (UTC)
::: There are some: <tt>Und das Gesagte ist das Folgende: „hier schläft man sich gesund.“</tt> (2004, Claudia Wipprecht, ''Zu: Gottfried Benns “Mann und Frau gehen durch die Krebsbaracke”'', page 12) Some adjectives, like ''[[rot]]'' and ''[[blau]]'' and ''[[gedacht]]'', can even be substantivised in reference to [[Blauer|males]], [[Blaue|females]] ''and'' [[Blaues|things]]. As you say, though, it's common for them to refer only to men and women, ''or'' only to things, not to all three. [[User:-sche|- -sche]] [[User talk:-sche|(discuss)]] 18:16, 9 February 2013 (UTC)
:::: Yeah, I was trying to think of nominalized adjectives with at least somewhat idiomatic meanings as nouns, like [[Arbeitspflichtiger]] or [[Abgeordneter]] have.

There's another problem with the declension table at {{term|letzter|lang=de}}. The first row shows predicative uses which don't exist. (Only the nominalized forms can be used in this position: ''Er ist [[Letzter]]'' = "He ist the last one". But not: *''Es ist Letztes'' = "It is the last one".) Could someone modify the template so it allows to hide the predicative row? [[User:Longtrend|Longtrend]] ([[User talk:Longtrend|talk]]) 19:02, 9 February 2013 (UTC)

: How would you say that in German then? In Dutch, you say "Hij is de/het laatste", with a definite article.

:: How would you say what? "It is the last one"? You would use the definite article here, too: ''Es ist '''das''' [[Letzte]].'' As for "he is the last one", ''Er ist der Letzte'' and ''Er ist Letzter'' roughly mean the same. ''Er ist '''das''' Letzte'' (the literal equivalent of ''Hij is het laatste''?) does work, too, though it has an idiomatic meaning ("he is an idiot") and thus doesn't work with other nominalized adjectives. // @-sche: Thanks for fixing!

== assigned female at birth ==

# What is the grammar of the phrase {{google|"assigned (female{{!}}male) at birth"}}? In particular, what POS is "female" in it? Is it an adverb, or an adjective in an ellipsis of "assigned to the female gender/sex", or perhaps a noun meaning "the feminine gender/sex" (a sense [[female|our entry]] lacks, as it only lists "''an individual of'' the feminine gender/sex")?
# What POS is "female" in {{google|"(female{{!}}male)-assigned at birth"}}? "Persons who were ''female-assigned'' at birth" seems grammatically analogous to "walls which were paint-covered at the start" or "frogs which were yellowish-coloured at birth", suggesting "female" could in ''that'' phrase be a noun (with what definition?) or an adjective and/or part of a compound adjective.
# Is "[[assigned female at birth]]" (or just "[[assigned female]]"?) idiomatic?

: "Assigned female at birth" sounds SoP to me, though I agree the grammar is a bit odd (could a fungus be "assigned vegetable")?

[[User:Equinox|Equinox]] [[User_talk:Equinox|◑]] 20:06, 6 February 2013 (UTC)

: I think the grammar is that "female" is a normal adjective, as usual, but that "assign" is taking an adjective complement, which it usually doesn't. That is, I think this is the same grammar as in "declared female", "deemed female", and so on. (And I ''don't'' think that "female-assigned" is using the same grammar as "yellowish-coloured", since the latter is "{yellowish-colour}ed", i.e. "having a yellowish colour", whereas I'm reasonably confident that "female-assigned" does not mean "having a female [[assign#Noun|assign]]".)

::Alternative analyses are that ''female'' is a nominal, possibly a fused-head construction "''female (gender)''" or possibly to be read as ''"female"'' rather than ''female''.

::: How many native speakers need an audio file for pronunciation? I don't hear the "p", but I live on a very busy street, and it's rush hour- so my ear may be filtering it out along with the background noise. I think this may have something to do with categorical perception: our ear/brain divides up the spectrum of sounds differently, depending on the training it receives in learning language. An ambiguous sound would get nudged over into different categories depending on how our categories are set up. As a native speaker, your ear is trained to hearing the phonemes of your native language, so that's what you hear.

== German Nominalization ==

Many German Nominalizations are missing cause there is no uniform tag for nominalized forms (often there is reference in etymology). I looked in [[:Category:Form of templates]] and there is no entry for that kind.

* '''Adjective''' example: every declined nominalized form of [[groß]] is missing:
** ein [[Großer]] (positive)
** einen [[Großen]]
** einem [[Großem]]
** ein [[Großes]]
** ein [[Größerer]]
** eine [[Größere]] (comperative)
** ein [[Größeres]]
** die [[Größte]] (superlative)
** ...

* The Nominalization of German '''verbs''' is often used in combination with prepositions (beim [[Sprechen]]) but right now only a few entries do exist (e.g. [[Laufen]])

And maybe the Nominalizations could talk part in the declension and conjugation tables in a new section.

Is "[[(aq)]]", complete with parenthesis, really the chemical abbreviation for "aqueous solution", or is it the case that the abbreviation is "aq", and it is merely set apart in parentheses, which would then not belong in the pagename?

==Tensometer-Tensiometer==
The definitions of [[tensometer]] and [[tensiometer]] here consider the two words to be interchangeable, is this correct? The articles at en wiki are now arranged so that [[:w:Tensometer]] is exclusively an instrument for measuring tensile strength, while [[:w:Tensiometer]] is now a disambiguation for one of two instruments one to measure surface tension and the second to measure the matric capacity in soil, with warnings on all pages not to confuse the three. In the related terms for [[tensiometer]], [[tensiometry]] only refers to the measurement of surface tension.

So is it a case that [[tensometer]] and [[tensiometer]] are interchangeable with no historical differences between the two save for personal preference, or is it a case that the two words are so similar that confused usage has led to the belief that they are the same.--[[User:KTo288|KTo288]] ([[User talk:KTo288|talk]]) 20:45, 11 February 2013 (UTC)

::We might try to resolve this by finding three or so authors for each distinction.

::::For what its worth had a look at the OED in the local library, and the first form of the word is '''tensometer''' being described as a device to measure tensile strenght, ''tensiometer'' appears as avariant form of ''tensometer'' however the example used describes a device for measuring surface tension, not tensile strength. In other examples-the older uses you allude to?- ''tensiometer'' is used to describe an instrument to measure the deformation of a material due to temperature change; and in the  context of textiles, a [[:w:Tension meter]]. Personally I'm coming to the conclusion that lexicographically ''tensometers''/''tensimeter'' are devices that measure tension or use tension to measure regardless of the field.--[[User:KTo288|KTo288]] ([[User talk:KTo288|talk]]) 20:45, 12 February 2013 (UTC)
:::::A standard way of measuring tensile strength is to measure [[strain]]. I believe that  ''[[strain gauge]]''/[[strain gauge]]'' is the same as or a correlative term of ''[[tensometer]]''. In one class of uses, a [[tensimeter]] is used with a tensiometer (soil science sense). Also soil science is the principal, but not the only, field to measure the difference in [[vapor pressure]] using a tensiometer.

Partisan conservative discourse is also the only place I've seen the "one who favours abortion being legal" sense. The term I think of as neutral for the first sense is "abortion provider". All terms for the second sense have some degree of bias in one direction or another, but the closest to neutral are "pro-choice [person]" (when used, e.g. by the news media, in conjunction with "pro-life [person]", such that the "[[loaded word|load]]s" balance out) and "abortion-rights advocate" (which is, however, not precisely neutral but somewhat [[positive]]ly-[[loaded word|loaded]]).

''Abortionist'', being a label of a person, is more likely to be used pejoratively than ''abortion''. Outside the realm of political discourse ''abortion'' is basically neutral, though I'm not so sure about ''abortionist''. What doctor would call himself an ''appendectomist''?

== butter becomes harder to spread ==

Is there a word, in any language, for what unrefrigerated butter or peanut butter does in the winter, when it "thickens" due to the cold and becomes harder to spread?

== Seven-level screwdriver ==

In the US military, a "[[seven-level]]" is someone who has received a certain specific level of technical training.  I have a bunch of citations for it, and plan to add that word.  My question concerns the combined form "seven-level screwdriver".  It's simply the well-known pocket 2.5-inch screwdriver with a straight, plastic handle, and it got the "seven-level" name because the seven-levels always carried one around.

My question concerns whether "seven-level screwdriver" satisfies [[Wiktionary:Criteria_for_inclusion#Attestation]].  I know of its use in one novel, ''[[w:A Smuggler's Bible|A Smuggler's Bible]]''.  Of the handful of academic works that discuss the book, one of them quotes the relevant sentence and then makes its own metaphor with "seven-level screwdriver".  Does that second use qualify as independent?

I have found one USENET posting with the term, and a few other online instances, maybe one that looks like it might have some permanence (the popular Air Force forums site).

The three possibilities for attestation are (1) it's "clearly widespread" (in the military) (2) ''A Smuggler's Bible'' qualifies as a "well-known" work (3) the three citation requirement can be cobbled together from the above.  [[User:Choor monster|Choor monster]] ([[User talk:Choor monster|talk]]) 15:07, 20 February 2013 (UTC)

: It might scrape through on the above. Why not start [[Citations:seven-level screwdriver]]? That can be used as a starting-point even if the word doesn't meet [[WT:CFI]] yet. [[User:Equinox|Equinox]] [[User_talk:Equinox|◑]] 16:32, 20 February 2013 (UTC)

:: I did not know we could do that!  OK, done.  I put in the two books, one USENET, and two forums that look they might have staying power.  I'll wait for feedback if this qualifies for inclusion.

::As a side issue, in putting together [[seven-level]] citations, I noticed several references were self-published books by military guys whose life was presumably too boring for commercial publication.  Are these allowed?

::: I don't think we have any rule against self-published books, though they can be very sloppily written and I would not like to see them used to attest careless misspellings as "alternatives". I've found them useful in citing [[AAVE]] words. [[User:Equinox|Equinox]] [[User_talk:Equinox|◑]] 17:36, 20 February 2013 (UTC)

::And as a second side issue, are individual meanings held to the attestation requirements?

[[User:Choor monster|Choor monster]] ([[User talk:Choor monster|talk]]) 17:31, 20 February 2013 (UTC)

:::: OK, I've decided to be bold and I created the [[seven-level screwdriver|Entry]], along with a [[Citations:seven-level screwdriver|Citations]] page.

== [[optimus]] ==

This was sometimes spelled [[optumus]] as well, because the middle syllable contained a vowel called [[sonus medius]], which fell somewhere in between i and u. The pronunciation section currently says /i/ but that was certainly not true for the earlier period, where it was /ɨ/ or /ʉ/. Should this be changed or explained? {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 17:26, 22 February 2013 (UTC)
: We could create a template for Latin pronunciations with sonus medius, which displays something like “Possibly {{IPA|/ˈop.tɨ.mus/|lang=la}} or {{IPA|/ˈop.tʉ.mus/|lang=la}}; see {{w|sonus medius}}.” Or we could add ''ˈop.tⱵ.mus'' as a non-IPA pronunciation. — ''[[User:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|Ungoliant]] <sup>([[User Talk:Ungoliant MMDCCLXIV|Falai]])</sup>'' 22:44, 23 February 2013 (UTC)
:: I'd presume that the spelling [[optimus]] has the non-rounded variety, while [[optumus]] represents the rounded version? {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 22:55, 23 February 2013 (UTC)
::: I think there was just one "sonus medius", which in earlier texts was sometimes spelled i and sometimes spelled u before the spellings settled down and became standardized. The problem is we don't know how rounded the sound was so we don't know whether ɨ or ʉ is the better way to transcribe it. I'd go with /ɨ/ just because /i - ɨ - u/ is typologically more common than /i - ʉ - u/, and at [[Appendix:Latin pronunciation]] we can explain that its precise degree of rounding is uncertain. —[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] 23:05, 23 February 2013 (UTC)
::::Hmm, I always say ɨ, but that's probably because I have trouble saying ʉ correctly, and the fact that <nowiki><i></nowiki> was the spelling settled on suggests that it's more likely, as well as Angr's analysis.

::::: Wikipedia has good information about Latin itself, but it has no information at all about diachronic processes that affected the early stages of the language.

''Rationalization'' could have two definitions that reference each of the senses of ''rationalize'': ''(uncountable)'' The process of rationalizing." and "''(countable)'' An instance of rationalizing."

== [[the]] ==

"Adverb" ''With a comparative, and often with for it, indicates a result more like said comparative. This can be negated with none.''
: ''It was a difficult time, but I’m the wiser for it.''
: ''It was a difficult time, and I’m none the wiser for it.''
: ''I'm much the wiser for having had a difficult time like that.''

This doesn't seem the least bit adverbial to be. It just seems to me to be ''the'' as a determiner in a "fused-head construction". In the first and third usage examples one could insert ''person'' or ''one'' after ''wiser''. In the second the "one" appears as part of ''none''.

Could anyone explain the choice of "adverb" here except as "not elsewhere classified"? [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  23:00, 24 February 2013 (UTC)

:But if these were fused head constructions, they'd be definite, and it's more idiomatic to use an indefinite noun phrase here. I wouldn't say "I'm the wiser person for it" or "I'm much the wiser person for having had a difficult time", I'd say "''a'' wiser person". And of course you can't do it in the second sentence (*"none the wiser person") at all. I think this is basically the same ''the'' as in sense 1 of the adverb. —[[User:Angr|'''An''']][[User talk:Angr|''gr'']] 12:01, 25 February 2013 (UTC)

== [[used to]] ==

This is a tricky expression, IMO. [[used to#Etymology 2]] had been presented as a Verb, representing the "imperfect tense". I think this was wrong. The essence of this expression is past habitual or repeated (but not continuous) action. It is ambiguous as to whether the action or habit has been terminated in the sense that although the implication is that it has been terminated (ie, perfect), it is rebuttable. One can say both "I used to smoke and I still do." and "I used to smoke, but I stopped" and they are both consistent with "I used to smoke." 

However, I think it is the use of "I" in the examples that makes for this implication. If I say "He used to smoke.", then the possibility/likelihood is that I don't have certain knowledge of the current state of his smoking habit.

If this analysis is correct, than the translations which are premised on the sense of incompletion are wrong.

I think that this can also be viewed as a modal adverb of aspect rather than a modal verb of aspect, though its interaction with "didn't" might be deemed to pull it into the verb word class. It is a bit simpler to consider it an adverb, IMO. [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  14:18, 25 February 2013 (UTC)

: I find the affirmation that this is an adverb difficult to maintain. It appears to be more your personal opinion (prescriptive), rather than the general opinion (descriptive) which holds it to be a defective verb. I would like to see it changed back to being a '''verb''' until the collective opinion decides differently. If you wouldn't mind.

::The presentation has nothing whatsoever to do with prescriptiveness as to usage. No assertion as to how this expression ought to be used was in any contribution of mine. The issue is which of two descriptions best describes the term, neither of which were in the previous version, which seemed simply wrong.
::If it is to be presented as a verb, I'd like to see it corrected to the habitual aspect rather than merely reverted.

OROLOGION is NOT an Italian word and is nit a derivative of orologium. In fact it is the reverse
Orologion is a Greek word it is comoprised by two words put together 

ORA it means "Hour" which nothing else but an Anglicised Greek word

LOGION Another Greek word meaning "Telling"

So orologion means someth9ing that "Tells the Hour"  - Watch or Clock

I have found multiple CFI citations for {{term|sabreuer}}, a misspelling of {{term|sabreur}}.  I see that certain notorious misspellings, like {{term|supercede}}, have their own entry, but I assume that in general this is not appropriate.  I also found two citations for {{term|beau sabreuer}}.  Notably, one citation anglicized the plural of the compound term: {{term|beau sabreuers}}, without the {{term|-x|lang=fr}}.  Suggestions? [[User:Choor monster|Choor monster]] ([[User talk:Choor monster|talk]]) 17:05, 1 March 2013 (UTC)
:We have {{temp|misspelling of|example|lang=en}} which yields: {{misspelling of|example|lang=en}}.
:What we don't have is an explicit standard for inclusion or exclusion. Mere attestability is not good enough because it is easy to find three examples of many, many misspellings, so that we might have more misspelling entries than entries for the correctly spelled words. A "common" misspelling is presumably:
:# attestable,
:# common relative to the correctly spelled term,
:# common enough in absolute terms to likely to cause users to look the term up, but
:# not so common as to be considered an alternative form (ie, not an error),
:# not intentionally produced so as to simulate a dialectal pronunciation, and
:# not produced by mechanical-type errors, ie, scannos.

:One can find instances of both countable and uncountable use of the noun. Neither is common and both seem "literary". I agree that ''plenty'' is not synonymous with ''adequate'' or ''enough''.

== [[gek op]], [[dol op]] ==

These both mean "crazy about". I'm not really sure what part of speech they should have, though. [[dol op]] is currently marked as an adjective, but it doesn't really seem like an adjective because it can't stand on its own. It has to modify something else, just like "crazy about" does. On the other hand, a phrase consisting of "dol op" and a noun ''is'' an adjective phrase, so it seems like this is kind of an incomplete adjective phrase, kind of like how prepositions are incomplete adverbial phrases. Is there such a thing as a prepositional adjective? {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 15:09, 2 March 2013 (UTC)
: It's just an adjective plus a preposition as [[dol]] can stand on its own (I presume?). I'd probably mark it as a phrase? [[User:Jamesjiao|Jamesjiao]] → <sup><small>[[User talk:Jamesjiao|T]] ◊ [[Special:Contributions/Jamesjiao|C]]</small></sup> 20:27, 2 March 2013 (UTC)
:: Yes, they are composed of an adjective, combined with a prepositional phrase. However, it's not "gek" or "dol" by themselves that are idiomatic in this case, but the whole phrase "gek/dol op (something)". {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 20:31, 2 March 2013 (UTC)

::: This reminds me of verbs with a "semi-fix" preposition, like "denken aan", "kijken naar", and phrases like "woedend zijn op iemand", "gesteld zijn op iets of iemand". I would say that "gek", "dol", "verzot" (and whatever) are adjectives, and they require a certain preposition in order to function correctly. This could be mentioned in the usage notes or in the usage examples. The whole phrase would be "dol zijn op" (etc) because the verb "zijn" seems to be required. --[[User:MaEr|MaEr]] ([[User talk:MaEr|talk]]) 12:15, 3 March 2013 (UTC)
:::: Except that it's not required. Any copula will do: ''zij blijft nog altijd gek op haar'' "she remains, as always, crazy about her". That is what makes this an adjectival phrase and not just a verb combined with some extra words. Syntactically, a phrase like ''is gek op chocolade'' would be parsed like (is (gek (op chocolade))) or like ((is gek) (op chocolade)), but not (is (gek op (chocolade))), so "op" is more like a preposition than something that belongs to "gek". The same applies to "denken aan" and "kijken naar", but those are verb+adverb combinations rather than copula+adjective. English has plenty of cases like this too... {{term|crazy about|lang=nl}} itself is, but we don't have an entry for that. We do have {{term|think about|lang=en}} and {{term|look at|lang=en}}, but we lack {{term|fond of|lang=en}} and {{term|angry with|lang=en}}. Yet I don't think that anyone would doubt that the chosen preposition in cases like these is more or less fixed, or else it's chosen from only a limited amount of possibilities. So it is certainly idiomatic to some degree. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 19:56, 3 March 2013 (UTC)

''I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you,” said she, “but as there is so little toast, you must have it now,” and she proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand. We feasted that evening '''as''' on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the delicate fare she liberally supplied.'' &mdash; '''''Jane Eyre''' Chapter 8''.

:"as" in that sentence is an elision or at least a synonym of "[[as if]]", "[[as though]]". I think that means it's the sense "''[[as#Conjunction|introducing a comparison with a hypothetical state]]''", which was tagged {{temp|obsolete}}, but which I just changed to {{temp|dated}} because I think it can still be used (and certainly, can still be understood, which makes it {{temp|archaic}} at worst).

::I dunno; the quotations under that sense use it in a way that genuinely seems obsolete to me, whereas Eyre's usage strikes me as merely literary or slightly archaic.

Hello, I want to report proof and evidence that admin SemperBlotto is running a script to revert some IP contributions without actually checking the edits:

* The suffix page [[-gasm]] missed a link to its derived-terms category, so I added it (as well as a one-line example) with my complete addition provided as the edit summary: [http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=-gasm&diff=prev&oldid=19686523]
* The article for [[orgasm]] had no link to its own suffix [[-gasm]], so just I added it with my complete addition as edit summary: [http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=orgasm&diff=prev&oldid=19686539]

He just undid all my edits at once.

Likewise, it's a philosophical question as to whether a combining form should be listed under "Derived terms", or under some other header.

There are currently entries for [[licenced]], [[licenced victualler]], and [[licenced victuallers]]. These are incorrect. Even in British English (which uses [[licence]] as a noun) the verb form is [[license]] and so the participle is [[licensed]] in all forms of English. Consider: [[Wikipedia:Federation of Licensed Victuallers Associations]] for example.

== [[Template:ergative]] ==

What am I missing?

Why is this somewhat obscure term (occurring only twice in BNC and not at all in COCA; not appearing in shorter English dictionaries, eg, Longman DCE 1987; not appearing in most grammars) put in front of our users as a grammatical context label?

In English, we often end up splitting the sense to which this might be applied into a transitive and an intransitive sense, following the practice of every dictionary I've ever cracked. Was this intended to be a temporary expedient, to avoid the need to type in two definitions? I don't object to the category, just to the label. [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  19:49, 11 March 2013 (UTC)
: What makes ergative verbs special is that they are active when transitive, but (medio-)passive when intransitive. We could of course split that into two senses, but there are some languages like Dutch where the significance is not just semantic, but also grammatical. The active voice uses {{term|hebben||to have|lang=nl}} as the auxiliary verb in the perfect tense, while the passive uses {{term|zijn||to be|lang=nl}}. This means that a normal verb that is used without an object is ''grammatically'' different from an ergative verb that is used without an object. An example is the verb {{term|smelten||to melt|lang=nl}}, which is ergative. When used with an object, it is active: imperfect ''ik smelt de sneeuw'' "I melt/am melting the snow", perfect ''ik '''heb''' de sneeuw gesmolten'' "I have melted the snow". But without an object, it is passive, and the perfect therefore takes the other auxiliary: imperfect ''de sneeuw smelt'' "the snow melts/is melting (by itself)", perfect ''de sneeuw '''is''' gesmolten'' "the snow has melted (by itself)". Contrast this with a non-ergative verb, {{term|eten||to eat|lang=nl}}. With an object: imperfect ''ik eet de sneeuw'' "I eat/am eating the snow", perfect ''ik '''heb''' de sneeuw gegeten'' "I have eaten the snow". Without an object: imperfect ''ik eet'' "I eat/am eating", perfect ''ik '''heb''' gegeten'' "I have eaten". {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 20:31, 11 March 2013 (UTC)
::I know what they are and why they are special. I am interested in whether the term belongs front and center in a sense line. 
::From what you've said so far, it seems that it is the kind of term that only certain language professionals could love.

[[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  21:52, 11 March 2013 (UTC)
::: But do you think that "transitive" is going to be understood that well? It is probably better known, yes, but how many people actually understand it in a linguistic sense? As a dictionary, linguistics (specifically lexicography, orthography and grammar) is our "field" and therefore we can't avoid linguistic jargon. I am not saying we shouldn't try to avoid making it too technical, but certain concepts are expressed much better with a linguistic term than with some other explanation. Besides, we do link to many jargon terms in our glossary, so that should "excuse" at least some of the uses. And in any case, if we don't use "ergative", how do we clearly express the behaviour of those Dutch verbs in an entry? Putting a usage note on each one seems excessive, as there may well be hundreds of those verbs. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 22:02, 11 March 2013 (UTC)
:: <small>(...after edit conflict...)</small>
:* I'm not sure I fully follow.  I mean, I understand your line of argument, CodeCat, I just don't think I agree.  :)
:: In terms of the perfect / imperfect senses, Dutch and German use their respective versions of "have" when an object is involved, and of "be" when there is no object, not even an implied one.  I really don't think this has to do with ergative / non-ergative -- it really looks like it has more to do with transitivity.  ''Ich '''habe''' gegessen'' ("I have eaten", implied object), ''Ich '''bin''' gegangen'' ("I have gone", no object possible).  The ''bin'' ("am") here is not at all passive, but rather more stative.  Meanwhile, English hasn't kept this distinction, so while we can still say things like "I am gone to the market", it rings strangely and might be misinterpreted.
:: By another analysis, one could say that verbs like "to melt", that are usually intransitive, are actually being used in a causative fashion when they take objects: ''I melt the snow'' == ''I '''make''' the snow melt''.  The use of "have" in other Germanic tongues (that I'm familiar with, anyway) always indicates an object: ''Ich habe geschmolzen'' necessarily implies an object by use of the verb "to have", while ''Ich bin geschmolzen'' certainly _could_ be passive, but not necessarily -- again, the ''bin'' here is more stative than passive, indicating a state or change in state.  (Appropriate, perhaps, for the verb "to be".)
:: Meanwhile, verbs like {{term|lang=en|eat}} or {{term|lang=nl|eten}} are inherently transitive and can be argued to _always_ have objects, even when left unstated.  ''I eat'' necessarily implies that something is the object.  One cannot ''eat'' without eating something.  Consquently, ''Ich bin gegessen'' indicates passivity _not_ just because of the use of ''bin'', but because of the inherent semantic qualities of the verb "to eat" in combination with this grammatical context.
:: I have run across suggestions that modern Germanic-language verbs that are simultaneously transitive and intransitive arose, at least in some cases, as the merger of older intransitive verbs and their causative forms.  Meanwhile, I haven't run across any solid arguments for an ergative verb structure in Germanic languages.  
:: But as with anything, I reserve the right to be wrong.  :)  -- [[User:Eirikr|Eiríkr&nbsp;Útlendi]]&nbsp;│&nbsp;<small style="position: relative; top: -3px;">''[[User talk:Eirikr|Tala&nbsp;við&nbsp;mig]]''</small> 22:36, 11 March 2013 (UTC)
::: (E/C) I don't think that is true. There are also verbs in Dutch that can never take an object, like {{term|zitten|lang=nl}} or {{term|liggen|lang=nl}}, but they still take {{term|hebben|lang=nl}} as the auxiliary. Moreover, any intransitive verbs that are newly created also take that auxiliary. So from a modern perspective, the ergative verbs are clearly the exception. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 23:03, 11 March 2013 (UTC)
:::* Dutch is, in many ways, kind of in between German and English.  Is it possible that Dutch is just following the same trend that happened in English, where the ''hebben'' vs. ''zijn'' distinction is being lost in perfect forms?
:::: And even with older verbs that never take an object but still use ''hebben'', 1) might these be early adopters of this English-y paradigm?  2) how are these ergative as opposed to nominative?  -- [[User:Eirikr|Eiríkr&nbsp;Útlendi]]&nbsp;│&nbsp;<small style="position: relative; top: -3px;">''[[User talk:Eirikr|Tala&nbsp;við&nbsp;mig]]''</small> 23:48, 11 March 2013 (UTC)
::::: There doesn't seem to be any trend. If anything, what is happening is that {{term|zijn|lang=nl}} is becoming more strongly associated with the passive voice to the extent that it wasn't already. To understand this you really have to look back at early Germanic history. The periphrastic perfect like it exists in Germanic languages nowadays was formed like a noun phrase originally. The past participle was originally an adjective that meant to be in a state of having undergone the verb's action (it was passive in meaning). So "seen" meant "that has been seen", and a sentence like "I have seen a friend" was no different from "I have a friend who is seen". "a friend who is seen" acted as the direct object of "have". Therefore, the difference between the two auxiliary verbs was quite clear: either you have a friend who is seen (I have a friend, "seen"), or you yourself are seen (I am "seen"). This also explains why the copula is used for the passive; it is the participle itself that is passive, and the verb "have" serves to make it active and/or transitive because it is itself active and transitive. There are some cases where English has actually preserved this better than Dutch: ''I am forgotten'' reflects the original semantics, whereas ''ik ben vergeten'' additionally has the meaning of "I have forgotten" and can also be transitive. This is an innovation within Dutch that has extended the use of the auxiliary "be" to convey a sense of not being responsible (grammatically speaking, an action with no agent; i.e. a mediopassive). The implication of ''ik ben vergeten'' is therefore that you could not help having forgotten, it just happened to you. {{User:CodeCat/signature}} 00:20, 12 March 2013 (UTC)

:::It would be necessary if the target audience for this dictionary is linguists rather than more generic users such as language learners. If linguists are our main target then we should expect WMF to pull the plug on us completely when they find out.
:::I thought the generic case for an ergative verb in English is "I melt the snow" and "The snow melts". If so many verbs can be used ergatively. "That wine drinks best with beef." is a transformation of something like "One drinks that wine best with beef." or "That wine is best drunk with beef.".

:::* Poking around, it looks like the etym for EN {{term|lang=en|melt}} is a bit unclear, but probably related to NL {{term|lang=nl|smelten}} and DE {{term|lang=de|schmelzen}}; for the latter two, from what I can glean, this is an older intransitive verb that melded (ha! :) with its causative form -- i.e., this isn't ergative, just a verb that can be both transitive and intransitive.  If it were "I melt him" and "him melts", then sure, I'd agree that this is ergative.  But the only way that utterance happens in modern English is when someone is 1) learning the language, or 2) being intentionally silly.  :::: As to whether to keep [[Template:ergative]], my understanding about WT is that we are attempting to describe each language as it is.  From my reading of {{w|Ergative-absolutive_language}}, these languages have constructs that cannot be clearly or cleanly described without relying upon specialized terminology.  Are we to mislead users by using the wrong terms to describe these languages?  I would prefer to use the correct descriptive terminology, albeit presented in as accessible a fashion as we can without dumbing things down too badly.  When it comes to ergative verbs, these don't really exist in nominative/accusative (intransitive/transitive) languages like English, and require proper description and explanation.

::::* I don't have access to Collins.  I disagree with their definition; I think they're describing the same thing as my understanding of "ergative", but doing so poorly, such that the meaning is muddled.  That said, Merriam-Webster's definition matches my understanding, and comes across more clearly (bolding mine):
<blockquote><blockquote>
{| align="center" width="100%" style="border: 1px solid rgb(170,170,170)"
|
of, relating to, or being a language (as Inuit or Georgian) in which '''the objects of transitive verbs and subjects of intransitive verbs''' are typically marked by the same linguistic forms; also : being an inflectional morpheme that typically marks the subject of a transitive verb in an ergative language 
|}
</blockquote></blockquote>
::::: English masks how this functions, by dint of not having grammatical case for most words.  Deliberately using case-bound words in English sentences makes it clear that English verbs are not ergative.  Examples:
:::::* I help him.
:::::* Him helps.
::::: If English were ergative, the above would both be correct.  However, English is not ergative.  English verbs have a nominative/accusative paradigm instead, and as part of this, the second sentence above is ungrammatical.
::::: I think "ergative" is a useful label -- for languages that actually have ergative verbs.  English is not one of these languages, and I am dismayed to see that [[:Category:English ergative verbs]] exists.

::::: As has been pointed out in a discussion on Eirikr's talk page, there's two different senses of [[ergative]] at play here: with respect to nouns, the ergative case is used to show the subject of a transitive verb. With respect to verbs, it refers to those that can take an active form even though the subject isn't the cause of the action. You can say "I broke the window" (active), or the window was broken by me (passive), or "the window broke" (mediopassive). In the latter, "the window" is the subject, but it's not the cause of the action: "the window broke" doesn't mean the same as "the window broke itself". This is something that's not really covered by the traditional transitive vs. intransitive distinction: in the sentence "he sat", "he" is clearly the cause of the action, and yet "he sat" and "the window broke" are both intransitive verbs. It also doesn't apply to most verbs: you can say "I read the newspaper", but not "the newspaper read". It's a very real and useful piece of information about the verb, but there's unfortunately no other term that I know of for it. We just need to explain it better. @DCD: you talk about the term as if it's uniquely obscure and confusing, but it's no more so than "fused head construction", which you use frequently, without explanation- as if everyone already knew what it is. [[User:Chuck Entz|Chuck Entz]] ([[User talk:Chuck Entz|talk]]) 00:50, 25 March 2013 (UTC)
::::::I take your point about fused-head constructions. Though I noted that CGEL said there was dispute about the concept, I didn't realize that it is not at all widespread in linguistic scholarship. But I did not advance it as a term to be put in front of users rather than a justification for us as lexiciographers to avoid proliferating PoS sections with duplicative semantic content.
::::::I do not think "ergative" needs to be explained to the great mass of users. As imperfect as users' understanding of transitive and intransitive may be, many users have some understanding of the terms, which understanding normally doesn't lead them astray.
::::::I wonder if the fundamental problem in this and many other matters is that I am reasonably sure that Wiktionary is and ought to be direct to helping relative casual users who have no great interest in linguistics as opposed to definitions and translations, whereas others think it is for the needs of language professions.
::::::Perhaps both sets of users could be accommodated by having tags like {{temp|ergative}} not display by default, but be displayed if some preference gadget provided other wise. That seems like something that could be easily done with CSS. It could even be varied by language, if need be. There is the difficulty that my view would require that there be two sense lines, one 'transitive', one 'intransitive' for all sense lines in English now marked 'ergative'.

::::English is a "singing" language, where any phrase has only 1, or maximum 2 stress points, so the difference is a lot easier to hear. We normally only stress the important word in a phrase. Affirmative statements are expected, and so "can" is normally unstressed, as not carrying any actually new information. Hence it is normally heard as a not-confusing /kn/ in a phrase such as "I can play the piano" - where "piano" would probably be the important, and hence stressed, word. "Can you?" "Can" here carries a stress, being a question word. Q words are not confusing either. Then we get to "can't". It sounds different, as stated above, because it carries a stress. It is negative, and so it is unexpected and important. If English used accents, there would be one on this word.

:: Definition 1 - The visible form usurping the entirety of the thing discussed
::: * A general and well accepted name for the visible portion of a complex phenomena which [[discharge|equalizes]] areas of spacial [[polarity]] within the atmosphere. "Lightning" is often used to describe the entire process, given the near instantaneous time of the visible event, but the multiple [[stroke|strokes]] of electrical [[current]] cause the visibility to which it is attributed. "Lightning" is composed of invisible portions happening over a much longer period of time and the sum total of a single event is termed a [[flash]].
:: Definition 2 - The physical properties of lightning & what they can cause or lead to
::: * A general term used to describe and simplify the electrical and physical properties of a complex phenomena which [[discharge|equalizes]] areas of spacial [[polarity]] within the atmosphere and also to the earth. Often "lightning" erroneously accepts larger responsibility than its much smaller and simpler brother, a [[spark]], ignoring the fact that without oxygen or fuel, lightning would go relatively unnoticed.

:Several comments: 1) If terms have different meanings in everyday speech and in specific scientific fields, e.g. meteorology, both meanings are welcome. 2) If, however, there is only one meaning — and everything that laymen call "lightning" is indeed "lightning" according to the scientific definition, even if the laymen think of it as a flash and the scientists describe it in terms of polarity/ionisation/etc — then as Chuck notes, the definition needs to be intelligible to the laymen, and should be relatively concise, because Wiktionary is not an encyclopedia or a technical reference work. That said, 3) the problem with the definitions you added earlier wasn't that they were overly scientific—they weren't—it was that they were more like jumbled commentaries on the use of the word "lightning" than ''definitions of'' lightning.

::Here's a look at how other dictionaries define "lightning":
::* Merriam-Webster: the flashing of light produced by a discharge of atmospheric electricity; ''also:'' the discharge itself
::* [http://oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/lightning Oxford]: a. the occurrence of a natural electrical discharge of very short duration and high voltage between a cloud and the ground or within a cloud, accompanied by a bright flash and typically also thunder; b. ''literary:'' a flash or discharge of lightning (as, ''the sky was a mass of black cloud out of which lightnings flashed'')
::* dictionary.com: a brilliant electric spark discharge in the atmosphere, occurring within a thundercloud, between clouds, or between a cloud and the ground
::* Collins: a flash of light in the sky, occurring during a thunderstorm and caused by a discharge of electricity, either between clouds or between a cloud and the earth
::* The Free Dictionary (1): a. an abrupt, discontinuous natural electric discharge in the atmosphere; b. the visible flash of light accompanying such a discharge
::* TFD (2): a brilliant electric spark discharge in the atmosphere, occurring within or between clouds, or between a cloud and the ground
TFD (3): A flash of light in the sky caused by an electrical discharge between clouds or between a cloud and the Earth's surface. The flash heats the air and usually causes thunder. Lightning may appear as a jagged streak, as a bright sheet, or in rare cases, as a glowing red ball.
:: Based on that and on how the words are commonly used, I've modified the definitions. As I wrote above: if, in meteorology, "lightning" can denote phenomena ''other than'' the (typically [[flash]]y) discharge of atmospheric electricity, that will need to be addressed.

#*: Most of your life after babyhood has been played out by the several '''yous'''.
#* '''2010''', Patrick M Morley, ''The Man in the Mirror: Solving the 24 Problems Men Face'' (page 36)
#*: There are two '''yous''' — the visible you and the real you. The visible you is the you that is known by others.
There's no noun sense at [[you]], nor is there any pronoun sense there that fits the quotes. My question, so I can fix it: is this really a noun, or is it a pronoun used as if it were a noun?

This particular construction can be used with just about any noun or pronoun: "Who is the real John Smith?". "The Las Vegas nobody sees"."Each  has his own particular reality". "This is the real me". Are we opening ourselves up for a whole new class of senses? On the other hand, the quotes show an easily-cited usage that doesn't seem all that much like that of a pronoun.

== [[alter]] ==

Apparently this word as a noun has a technical jargon meaning in social network theory and likely in related fields. [http://www.bmj.com/content/337/bmj.a2338 'This article from BMJ'] says, in the Glossary,  "Alter: a person connected to the ego; this is the person who is potentially influencing the behaviour of the ego" (and "ego" is itself a technical term, not used in the psychological but a network sense of an individual node). I'm not in this field but found the use, with no explanation, in the article [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5758588782893502057 'Network Structure and Information Advantage'], e.g. "In addition, the
greater structural awareness of actors in constrained networks (Coleman 1988) may enable alters to differentiate their information flows from one another," so it has probably become an accepted technical term. It would be helpful if it could be added to the Wiktionary.

== [[sosh]] ==

This entry, meaning 2, is problematic.  My original definition consisted of a list of terms that all begin "social" and end up abbreviated to "sosh", for example, "socialist", "social studies", "social security number", "social climber".  (There's also "sociology", as in the college department.)  There are others that I have been unable to find CFI attestation, like "social engineer" and the "sosh cut" hair style.

This definition was a mess, and it was changed recently to an "abbreviation of social", which was less messy, but not quite accurate&mdash;that's the etymology!&mdash;so I've changed it to an "abbreviation for various terms beginning 'social'".  But ultimately, that's just a cop out on what was wrong with my original definition.

The different meanings are of course all different senses, yet "sosh" seems to have an innate productivity or flexibility that listing multiple senses doesn't convey.  (Personally, I had come across the word a few times and instantly forgot it, then thought I had learned the word for life as an abbreviation for the verb "social engineer" in Michael Connelly ''Chasing the Dime'', but that memory seems to be delusional, meanwhile, when I later heard a government bureaucrat on the phone ask me for my "sosh", I knew instantly what he was asking for.)  In contrast, "chem", for example, abbreviates "chemistry", but not "chemical engineer" or "chemical reaction".  Or simply contrast the first meaning of "sosh", an abbreviation for "association store".  No related abbreviation seems to exist.

Presumably there's a linguistic or grammatical concept here, something backwards from the word-building capability of particles like "-gate", but I'm grasping at straws here.

By the way, is this [http://digital.denverlibrary.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/p15330coll22/id/80767/rec/23 sosh cut] CFI usable? [[User:Choor monster|Choor monster]] ([[User talk:Choor monster|talk]]) 18:32, 3 April 2013 (UTC)
:Obviously, I prefer the brief "abbreviation of social" with some kind on {{temp|non-gloss definition}} thereafter. But increasingly we have all kinds of usually unsupported research notes under "Usage notes", "Etymology", "Pronunciation notes" etc. [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  09:23, 5 April 2013 (UTC)
::Your approach was definitely superior&mdash;I only tweaked it.  And I try to support my research: the "association store" etymology is taken from the References, and has been there from the creation of the article.

::Meanwhile I'm sitting on more citations for some of the senses.  I've posted here because I'm hesitant to go forward.  This term seems to fall between some cracks.  Sense 2 is really Etymology 2.  But breaking up 2 into proper CFI senses is going to succeed with some while leave a remainder put in a "miscellaneous" bag, either explicitly like done now, or implicitly, see "Citations".  That has to be wrong.  But to not refer to the {{term|social}}→{{term|sosh}} productivity also seems wrong.  That's what I'm stuck on.

::To phrase it differently, Sense 1 (the Scottish co-op), based on Etymology 1, is from a dead, non-productive etymology.  Sense 2 needs to be split up into senses, while its etymology should be indicated as still live.  That's what I was getting at with the {{term|-gate}} indication above, which has one permanent usage and endless numbers of temporary usages.

== gone to a better place ==

When I saw the new entry for {{l/pt|ir dessa para uma melhor}}, I thought I would add a link to the equivalent term in English- but we don't seem to have it. 

I've seen both "They've gone to a better place" and "They're in a better place, now" in discussing someone's death. Both could be interpreted as euphemisms for death, or "a better place" could be interpreted a an indirect way of saying "[[heaven]]".

It's not ''completely'' equivalent to heaven, since it's generally used when discussing how bad it was for the deceased before they died, so there's a literal element to the phrase- but it's understood that the "better place" isn't a physical one in the present world, such as Hawaii.

''Rotary dial'' has been used to differentiate the older type in ''rotary dial phone/telephone''. ''Rotary dial'' alone is not commonly used as a noun ("He still had on of those rotary dials."). Strictly speaking, I think all of the use as a nominal is a fused-head construction with the fused head being obvious from context. But contributors get so much fun from this kind of entry, why not have it anyway? It needs an {{temp|rfi}}.
:As to the PoS, I don't think its usage shows much adjectivity apart from attributive use. OTOH there is some predicative use, certainly more than three instances. [[User: DCDuring |DCDuring]] <small >[[User talk: DCDuring|TALK]]</small >  20:26, 12 April 2013 (UTC)

:: A rotary dial is the thing on the front of the phone that you turn when you dial. The fact that it turns, instead of being fixed like the dial on an analog wristwatch, is what makes it rotary. A rotary-dial phone is one that has a rotary dial instead of push-buttons, and is thus attributive use of the noun, "rotary dial" being a variant stemming from failure to hyphenate. Of course, etymology doesn't dictate usage, so it may have been reanalyzed as a compound adjective: one can speak of either a [[rotary phone]] or a [[dial phone]] (both with the same meaning as "rotary dial phone"), so it might be a [[pleonasm]] like [[hot water heater]].

:: It looks to me like we need to add a noun sense to [[rotary dial]] to cover the dial itself- unless it's SOP. The entry at [[rotary phone]] assumes that we already have one. If there really is an adjective sense, then the second sense in the current entry  could be either a [[nominalization]] of the first sense, or a [[synechdoche]] based on the rotary dial phone's main feature. It also wouldn't surprise me if there were both adjective and attributive-noun variations in use- both hyphenated and non-hyphenated examples are fairly common.

== [[four foot]] ==

We have entries at [[four foot]] for a rail transport term and [[4-foot]] for a curling term and [[four-foot]] as an alternative form of both. I've fairly crudely linked them as alternative forms of each other as a quick glance showed they're both used for both. It would be good though if someone could take a look at them, and maybe see whether the entries are actually at the most common form for each meaning or if it would be better to put both on the same page? [[user:Thryduulf|Thryduulf]] ([[user talk:Thryduulf|talk]]) 13:03, 15 April 2013 (UTC)
:Oh and there are the related terms [[six foot]] (rail transport), [[12-foot]] (curling) and [[8-foot]] (curling). I've not looked around all the other forms of these, but they should probably be handled similarly. [[user:Thryduulf|Thryduulf]] ([[user talk:Thryduulf|talk]]) 13:06, 15 April 2013 (UTC)

{{rel-top|pronunciation notes}}
The word ''the'' is commonly pronounced /ðiː/ whenever it is pronounced as a distinct word, e.g.:
* When it is used for emphasis (''This is ''the'' hospital for heart surgery.'').
* When the speaker pauses between ''the'' and the next word (''the … sovereignty'').
* In many but not all dialects, when the next word begins with a vowel sound {{qualifier|the onion}} (compare with [[a]] vs. [[an]]).
<!--no: this is not true: * When referred to as a word (''the word “the”''). -->
The word is generally pronounced indistinctly as /ðə/ or merely /ð/ in other situations, such as when attached to a word beginning with a consonant sound. <!--well, ''thus'' and ''th' U.S.'' are different in many ways, neither really including a glottal stop — In dialects that do not pronounce ''the'' distinctly before a vowel, a glottal stop is generally inserted (e.g., ''the US'' in ''the US festival'' would still be pronounced differently from ''thus'' in ''thus festival seating should be outlawed'').-->

{{rel-top|"the" vs. "ye"}}
* The [[eye dialect|typographical pronunciation]] /jiː/ (''"'''[[ye#Etymology_2|Ye]]''' Old..."'') is a deliberately archaic [[retronym]] from {{term|ye#Etymology_2|ẏe|sc=Latinx}}, which is a variant spelling of [[þe]], from Old English [[þe#Old English|þē]] pronounced '''''thē''''', /ðeː/ (using [[%E1%BA%8F]] in place of the [[thorn]] ([[þ]]). It is not actually a separate pronunciation in Middle English.
* The actual [[morpheme]] /jiː/ in Middle English represents [[%C8%9De-]], a variant spelling of the prefix [[y-]] attached to [[verb]]s and used to denote a verbal [[past participle]].

==Crimean Gothic==

===Etymology===
From {{etyl|gem-pro|gme-cgo}} {{recons|sa|lang=gem-pro}}, {{recons|sō|lang=gem-pro}}, {{recons|þat|lang=gem-pro}}.

===Article===

# [[#English|the]]
#* 1562, Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq:
#*: omnibus vero dictionibus praeponebat articulum tho aut '''the'''

====Usage notes====
While it is likely that Crimean Gothic retained grammatical gender, de Busbecq's letter does not mention which articles are used with which words, making it impossible to reconstruct their gender.

@ abusage
$ ==English==

===Etymology===

'''Abusage''' first appeared in the 16th century as a general synonym of [[abuse]], but it fell into disuse after just a couple of centuries. The word reemerged in the language with a new grammar-specific sense after Eric Partridge published a book on grammar titled ''Usage and Abusage'' in 1942.

* "This word, as used in law, is spelt ''accessory'' by Blackstone and many others; but in this sense is spelt ''accessary'' by Bouvier, Burrill, Burns, Whishaw, Dane, and the [[Penny Cyclopedia]]; while in other senses it is spelt ''accessory''. In recent [[text-books]] on criminal law the distinction is not [[preserved]], the spelling being either ''accessary'' or ''accessory''." - ''Webster, 1913''  Since that time this trend has accelerated.

#:* Now, I still think that for this box of matches to have escaped the wear of time for immemorial years was a strange, and for me, a most fortunate thing. Yet oddly enough I found here a far more unlikely substance, and that was camphor. I found it in a sealed jar, that, by chance, I supposed had been really hermetically sealed. I fancied at first the stuff was paraffin wax, and smashed the jar '''accordingly'''. But the odor of camphor was unmistakable. It struck me as singularly odd, that among the universal decay, this volatile substance had chanced to survive, perhaps through many thousand years. Is reminded me of a sepia painting I had once seen done from the ink of a fossil Belemnite that must have perished and become fossilized millions of years ago. I was about to throw this camphor on one side, and then remembering that it was inflammable and burnt with a good bright flame, I put it into my pocket.

===Noun===
{{en-noun}}

# {{grammar}}: a word in the form in which it potentially refers to something other than one person or thing; and other than two things if the language has a ''[[dual]]'' form.

====Usage notes====
* Many languages have [[singular]] and plural forms for one item or more than one item. Some have a singular form for one, [[dual]] form for two, [[trial]] form for three, [[paucal]] form for several, and plural for more than two (e.g., [[Arabic]], [[Fijian]]).
* While the plural form generally refers to two or more persons or things, that is not always the case. The plural form is often used for [[zero]] persons or things, for fractional things in a quantity greater than one, and for people or things when the quantity is unknown.
* In English, the plural is most often formed simply by adding the letter "[[s]]" to the end of a noun, e.g. [[apple]]/[[apples]]. There are many exceptions, however, such as [[echo]]/[[echoes]], [[mouse]]/[[mice]], [[child]]/[[children]], [[deer]]/[[deer]] (same word), etc.

@ Wiktionary:Copyrights
$ {{policy-DP}}
The goal of Wiktionary is to develop a freely available international dictionary for everyone. The realities of modern copyright law demand that we pay attention to legal issues to ensure that our work can be made available, and to protect the project from legal liability.

Original text of Wiktionary entries are dual-licensed to the public under both the '''[[WT:CC-BY-SA|Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License]]''', as well as '''[[WT:GFDL|GNU Free Documentation License]]''' (GFDL). The full text of both licenses can be found at [[Wiktionary:Text of Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License]], as well as [[Wiktionary:Text of the GNU Free Documentation License]]. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify the text of all Wiktionary entries under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License, and the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1 or any later version published by the [[w:Free Software Foundation|Free Software Foundation]]; '''with no Invariant Sections, with no Front-Cover Texts, and with no Back-Cover Texts'''.

Essentially, this means that the entries will remain free forever and can be used by anybody subject to restrictions mentioned below, which serve to ensure that freedom. 

Frequently, Wiktionary entries may include text, images, sounds, or other material from external sources with different copyright terms, and which is used with permission or under "[[w:fair use|fair use]]" doctrine. In this case, the material will be identified as from an external source (on the image description page, history page, or talk page as appropriate) and copyright holders of that material retain their rights.  Quoting a sentence from a contemporary author to illustrate his use of a word is an important example of fair use, but properly identifying the source is still essential.

==Contributors' rights and obligations==
If you contribute material to Wiktionary, you thereby license it to the public under CC-BY-SA and GFDL (with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts). In order to contribute, you therefore must be in a position to grant this license, which means that either:

* you own the copyright to the material, for instance because you produced it yourself, or
* you acquired the material from a source which allows licensing under CC-BY-SA or GFDL, for instance because the material is in the public domain or is itself published under CC-BY-SA and GFDL, or
* copyright no longer subsists in the material, meaning that it is in the public domain under copyright law. 

In the first case, you retain copyright to your materials. You can later republish and relicense them in any way you like. However, you can never retract CC-BY-SA licensing or the GFDL license for the versions you placed here: that material will remain under GFDL forever. In the second case, if you incorporate external CC-BY-SA or GFDL materials, you need to acknowledge the authorship on the history page or [[w:talk page|talk page]] and provide a link back to the network location of the original copy. If the original copy required invariant sections, you have to incorporate those into the Wiktionary article; but as with texts used with permission, CC-BY-SA or GFDL texts with invariant sections should be replaced with original or more freely licensed text whenever possible.

If you use part of a copyrighted work under "fair use", or if you obtain special permission to use a copyrighted work from the copyright holder, you must note that fact (along with names and dates) on the history page or talk page of the article. It is our goal to be able to freely redistribute as much of Wiktionary's material as possible, so original material licensed under CC-BY-SA or the GFDL is greatly preferred to copyrighted material (even used with permission) for our purposes.

Never use materials that infringe the copyrights of others. This could create legal liabilities and seriously hurt the project. If in doubt, write it yourself.  In extreme cases of contributors continuing to post copyrighted material after appropriate warnings, such users may be blocked from editing to protect the project.

Note that copyright law governs the creative expression of ideas, not the ideas or information themselves. Therefore, it is perfectly legal to read a dictionary entry, or other work, reformulate it in your own words, and submit it to Wiktionary. (See [[w:plagiarism|plagiarism]] and fair use for discussions of how much reformulation is necessary in a general context.)

Individual words are not copyrightable, although some may be trademarks, but this does not prevent us from using these words as long as we are not producing a product to compete with the trademark holder.  Lists of words in a standard arrangement such as alphabetical order are not copyrightable, but using a selection similar to that of another person may draw suspicions.  Using a definition from a copyright dictionary may infringe on copyrights, but may nevertheless be a fair use.  Indeed, a definition is often a '''short''' description of a word's meaning which may inadvertently be identical to what is found in a published work.  Any claim for copyright infringement would likely depend on proving a pattern of individual infringements.

== Users' rights and obligations ==
If you want to use Wiktionary materials in your own books/articles/web sites or other publications, you may do so, but you have to follow CC-BY-SA or the GFDL. CC-BY-SA entails the following requirements:
* your materials in turn have to be licensed under the same, similar, or compatible license,
* you must attribute the work in the manner specified by the author or licensor (but not in any way that suggests that they endorse you or your use of the work);

the GFDL entails these requirements:
* your materials in turn have to be licensed under GFDL,
* you must acknowledge the authorship of the article (section 4B), and
* you must provide access to the "transparent copy" of the material (section 4J). (The "transparent copy" of a Wiktionary article is its wiki text.) These last two obligations can be fulfilled by providing a conspicuous link back to the home of the article here at [http://www.wiktionary.org wiktionary.org]. 

If the Wiktionary article you wish to use contains text, images, sounds, or other material from external sources used with permission or under fair use, you must comply with the separate copyright terms for that material as well. For example, if we include an image under fair use, you must ensure that your use of the article also qualifies for fair use (this might not be the case, for example, if you were using a Wiktionary article for a commercial use that would otherwise be allowed by CC-BY-SA or the GFDL).

== If you find a copyright infringement ==
It is not the job of rank-and-file Wiktionarians to police every article for possible copyright infringement, but if you suspect one, remain calm and then you should at the very least bring up the issue on that page's talk page. Administrators will examine the situation and take action if needed. The most helpful piece of information you can provide is a URL or other reference to what you believe is the source of the text.

There is a standard text for this notice which explains the situation to the poster in the [[w:Wikipedia:Boilerplate text|Wikipedia:Boilerplate text]] page.

Some cases will be false alarms. For example, if the contributor was in fact the author of the text which is published elsewhere under different terms, that does not affect his right to post it here under CC-BY-SA or the GFDL unless it was contrary to his contract with his publisher, but you have no way of knowing if that is so. Also, sometimes you will find text elsewhere on the web that was copied from Wiktionary. In both of these cases, it is a good idea to make a note in the talk page to discourage such false alarms in the future.

If a page really is an infringement, then an administrator will delete the infringing content and make a note to that effect in the talk page, along with the original source. If the author's permission is obtained later, it can be restored.

===Pronunciation===
* {{audio|En-uk-spring.ogg|Audio (UK)}}
* {{enPR|sprĭng}}, {{IPA|/sprɪŋ/}}, {{X-SAMPA|/sprIN/}}
* {{audio|en-us-spring.ogg|Audio (US)}}
* {{rhymes|ɪŋ}}

===Etymology===
From {{etyl|enm}} {{term|springen|lang=enm}}, from Old English {{term|springan|lang=ang}}, from {{etyl|gem-pro|en}} {{recons|springanan|lang=gem-pro}} (compare {{etyl|fy|-}} {{term|springe|lang=fy}}, Dutch/German {{term|springen|lang=nl}}, Danish {{term|springe|lang=da}}. Swedish {{term|springa|lang=sv}}), from {{etyl|ine-pro|en}} {{recons|spr̥g̑h|lang=ine-pro}} (compare Lithuanian {{term|spreñgti|lang=lt}} ‘to push in’, Old Church Slavonic {{term||pręgti}} ‘to spin, stretch’, Ancient Greek {{term||spérchesthai}} ‘to hasten’, Sanskrit {{term||spṛhayati}} ‘is eager’).

Sense of ‘season’ 1547, from earlier ''springing time,'' ''spring-time,'' in sense of buds sprouting or “spring” up. This replaced Old English {{term|Lent}} by the 14th century.<ref name="etyl">{{R:Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref>

Sense of ‘source of water’ attested circa 1225.<ref name="etyl" />

===Verb===
{{en-verb|springs|springing|'''[[sprang]]''' ''or'' '''[[sprung]]'''|sprung}}

# To [[jump]] or [[leap]].
#: ''He '''sprang''' up from his seat.''
#* '''1900''', {{w|L. Frank Baum}}, {{w|The Wonderful Wizard of Oz}}
#*: She was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had not been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt. As it was, the jar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened; and Toto put his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally. Dorothy sat up and noticed that the house was not moving; nor was it dark, for the bright sunshine came in at the window, flooding the little room. She '''sprang''' from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran and opened the door.
#* '''1912''': {{w|Edgar Rice Burroughs}}, {{w|Tarzan of the Apes}}, Chapter 5
#*: Not thirty paces behind the two she crouched&mdash;Sabor, the huge lioness&mdash;lashing her tail. Cautiously she moved a great padded paw forward, noiselessly placing it before she lifted the next. Thus she advanced; her belly low, almost touching the surface of the ground--a great cat preparing to '''spring''' upon its prey.
#* '''1922''', {{w|Virginia Woolf}}, ''{{w|Jacob's Room}}'' Chapter 2
#*: Archer and Jacob jumped up from behind the mound where they had been crouching with the intention of '''springing''' upon their mother unexpectedly, and they all began to walk slowly home.
# To produce or disclose unexpectedly, especially of [[surprise]]s, [[trap]]s, etc.
#* '''29 February 2012''', Aidan Foster-Carter, BBC News [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-17213948 ''North Korea: The denuclearisation dance resumes'']
#*: North Korea loves to '''spring''' surprises. More unusual is for its US foe to play along.
# {{slang}} To [[release]] or [[set free]], especially from [[prison]].

====Usage notes====
* The past-tense forms {{term|sprang|lang=en}} and {{term|sprung|lang=en}} are both well attested historically. In modern usage, {{term||sprang|lang=en}} is comparatively formal (and more often considered correct), {{term||sprung|lang=en}} comparatively informal. The past participle, however, is overwhelmingly {{term||sprung|lang=en}}; {{term||sprang||lang=en}} as a past participle is attested, but is no longer in standard use.

====Synonyms====
* {{sense|jump, leap}} [[bound]], [[jump]], [[leap]]

Before a word beginning with a vowel sound, {{term|de}} elides to {{term|d'|d’|lang=fr}}. Before the article {{term|le|lang=fr}}, it contracts with the article into {{term|du|lang=fr}}, as shown in the example above. Before the article {{term|les|lang=fr}}, it contracts with the article into {{term|des|lang=fr}}.

Gordon, ''The Letter Names of the Latin Alphabet'' ([[w:University of California Press|University of California Press]], 1973; volume 9 of ''University of California Publications: Classical Studies''), part III: “Summary of the Ancient Evidence”, page 32: "Clearly there is no question or doubt about the names of the vowels A, E, I, O, U. They are simply long A, long E, etc. (ā, ē, ī, ō, ū). Nor is there any uncertainty with respect to the six mutes B, C, D, G, P, T. Their names are bē, cē, dē, gē, pē, tē (each with a long E).

=====Usage notes=====
* {{term|de|De|lang=la}} denotes the [[go out|going out]], [[departure]], [[removal]], or [[separation|separating]] of an object from any fixed point (it occupies a middle place between {{term|ab||away from|lang=la}} which denotes a mere external departure, and {{term|ex||out of|lang=la}} which signifies from the interior of a thing. Hence verbs compounded with {{term|de|lang=la}} are constructed not only with {{term|de}}, but quite as frequently with {{term|ab|lang=la}} and {{term|ex|lang=la}}; and, on the other hand, those compounded with {{term|ab|lang=la}} and {{term|ex|lang=la}} often have the {{term|terminus a quo}} indicated by {{term|de|lang=de}}).

==Low German==

===Etymology===

From {{etyl|osx|nds}}.

===Pronunciation===

* {{IPA|/dɛɪ̯/|lang=nds}}

===Article===
{{head|nds|article|genitive|der|dative|den|accusative|de|definite article}}

# [[the]]

====Usage notes====
* This is the only plural article and like English 'the' is used for nouns of every gender and class. Indefinite nouns in plural are used without article, again as in English.

===Article===
{{head|nds|article|g=f|genitive|der|dative|der|accusative|de|definite article}}

# [[the]]
#* ''De Fru gat hen.'' (The woman walks [lit. goes] there.)

===Article===
{{head|nds|article|g=m|genitive|des|dative|dęme|accusative|denne|definite article}}

# [[the]]
#* ''De Mann gat hen.'' (The man walks [lit. goes] there.)

====Usage notes====
* Dative or accusative are sometimes called 'object case'. However, most (if not all) dialects have not built a proper Objective case.
* Dem (from Middle Low German 'deme') can be found as 'den' as well due to interchangeability of ''m'' and ''n'' in Middle Low German.

===Pronoun===
{{head|nds|pronoun|g=m|accusative|den}}

# {{relative|lang=nds}} [[which]], [[that]]
#* ''De Mann, '''de''' dår güng.'' (The man, '''which''' walked there.)
#* ''De Mann, '''den''' wi hüert häbben.'' (The man, '''which''' we hired.)

====Usage notes====
* The use as a relative pronoun might not be present in all dialects.

===Pronoun===
{{head|nds|pronoun|g=f|accusative|de}}

# {{relative|lang=nds}} [[which]], [[that]]
#* ''De Fru, '''de''' wi hüert hębben.'' (The woman, '''which''' we have hired.)

====Declension====
{{sv-decl-ppron}}

===Article===
{{head|sv|article}}

# [[the]], a definite article used in the beginning of noun phrases containing attributive adjectives and nouns '''in the plural'''. This article is used '''together''' with the definite suffix of the noun to indicate the definiteness of the noun phrase.
#: '''''de''' gröna bilar'''na'''''
#:: the green cars

====Usage notes====
The same type of noun phrases with singular nouns instead use [[den]] (common gender) or [[det]] (neuter) for this function. Some definite noun phrase with attributive adjectives may skip these preceding articles. This is the case especially for many lexicalized noun phrases and also for many noun phrases working as proper names of organisations, geographical places, TV shows, events and similar.
: ''Brittiska öar'''na'''''
:: The British Isles

While the personal pronoun ''de'' has an object form and a genitive form, the definite article ''de'' is unaffected by the syntactic role of the noun phrase.

In the US, the spelling ''color'' is used to match the spelling of the word's Latin etymon{{,}} and to make all derivatives consistent (''colorimeter'', ''colorize'', ''colorless'', etc). Elsewhere in the English-speaking world, the spelling ''colour'' has been retained.

====Usage notes====
The late {{etyl|xno}} ''colour'', which is the standard UK spelling, has been the usual spelling in Britain since the 14th century and was chosen by {{w|Samuel Johnson|Dr. Johnson}}'s ''{{w|A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary of the English Language}}'' (1755) along with other {{etyl|xno}} spellings such as [[favour]], [[honour]], etc. The Latin spelling ''color'' was occasionally used from the 15th century onward, mainly due to Latin influence; it was lemmatized by {{w|Noah Webster|Webster}}'s ''{{w|Webster's Dictionary|American Dictionary of the English Language}}'' (1828), along with [[favor]], [[honor]], etc., and is currently the standard US spelling.

In Canada, ''colour'' is preferred, but ''color'' is not unknown; in Australia, ''-our'' endings are the standard, although ''-or'' endings had some currency in the past and are still sporadically found in some regions.

==Catalan==

===Etymology 1===
From the final syllable of {{etyl|la|ca}} {{term|lang=la|domine||Mister}}.

====Article====
{{head|ca|article|elided|n'|g=m|g2=s|feminine|na}}

# {{Eastern Catalan}} Personal article used before masculine given names instead of the definite article {{term|lang=ca|el}}.

=====Derived terms=====
* {{l|ca|can}} {{qualifier|contraction of ''ca'' and ''ne''}}

=====Usage notes=====
* While this article (and its feminine counterpart {{term|lang=ca|na}}) is standard in Baleric Catalan, in other Eastern Catalan dialects its use is waning, and the elided of the definite article, {{term|lang=ca|l'}}, is used before names beginning with vowels. There is no plural personal article, so the plural definite article {{term|lang=ca|els}} is used in all dialects.

===Etymology 2===
From {{etyl|la|ca}} {{term|in||in, inside|lang=la}}.

===Etymology 3===
From {{etyl|la|ca}} {{term|inde||thence|lang=la}}.

====Pronoun====
{{ca-ppron|type=procl|procl_con=n'|encl=ne|encl_con='n}}

# ''represents an indeterminate number or quantity of a given noun''
# ''represents a place (associated with the action described by the verb) that would be introduced by the preposition [[de#Catalan|de]]''
# ''replaces a phrase introduced by the preposition [[de#Catalan|de]]''
# ''replaces the object of a [[causative]] verb''

=====Usage notes=====
* '''En''' cannot be used more than once as the object of a given verb.
* While '''en''' is usually used to replace phrases beginning with the prepostion [[de#Catalan|de]], ''adverbial'' phrases (e.g., [[de pressa]]) are replaced with [[hi#Catalan|hi]].
* '''En''' is sometimes used instead of [[ho#Catalan|ho]] to replace an adjective or indefinite noun as the predicate of a verb.
* '''En''' is sometimes used popularly to add emphasis to a sentence: in this sense, it has no translation in English.
* When '''en''' is used as a preposition to introduce the object of a verb, this object is replaced not by '''en''' but by [[hi#Catalan|hi]]:
*: ''No crec '''en''' Déu'' → ''No '''hi''' crec''.

==Finnish==

===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|[en]|lang=fi}}
* {{hyphenation|en|lang=fi}}

===Verb===
{{head|fi|verb negative form}}

# The first-person singular form of the [[negation]] [[verb]]. The English translations include ''[[do]] [[not]]''/''[[don't|don’t]]'' and ''[[not]]'' (with auxiliary verbs and ''[[be]]'').

====Conjugation====
* The negative verb has ''no infinitive form''. The negative verb is the same with indicative, conditional and potential mood and, with those moods, it is conjugated only in person. (For the negative verb in the [[imperative]] mood, see ''[[älä]]''/''[[älköön]]''/''[[älkäämme]]''/''[[älkää]]''/''[[älkööt]]'' &mdash; the first person singular, naturally, does not have an imperative form. An archaic [[w:Optative mood|optative mood]] has a second-person singular form, ''[[ällös]]''.)

|-
| first person || '''en''' || [[emme#Finnish|emme]]
|-
| second person || [[et#Finnish|et]] || [[ette#Finnish|ette]]
|-
| third person || [[ei#Finnish|ei]] || [[eivät#Finnish|eivät]]
|}

====Usage notes====
* The negative verb is used with the connegative form of the main verb. That form is identical to the second-person singular imperative in the indicative present. The potential mood connegative ends in the marker for the mood, ''-ne-'', and the conditional mood connegative ends in the marker for the mood, ''-isi-''. In the indicative past, conditional past and potential past, the ''active'' past participle singular (ending -''ut''/-''yt'') is used. ''The connegative form of the main verb is always used without the personal suffix''.

:* Usage of ''en'':
::* Indicative:

:::* [[minä|Minä]] [[nähdä|näen]]. (I see.) -> Minä '''en''' näe. (I ''do not'' see.)
:::* Minä näin. (I saw.) -> Minä '''en''' nähnyt. (I ''did not'' see.)
:::* Minä [[olla|olen]] nähnyt. (I have seen.) -> Minä '''en''' ole nähnyt. (I have ''not'' seen.)
:::* Minä olin nähnyt. (I had seen.) -> Minä '''en''' ollut nähnyt. (I had ''not'' seen.)

::* Conditional:
:::* Minä näkisin. (I would see.) -> Minä '''en''' näkisi. (I would ''not'' see.)
:::* Minä olisin nähnyt. (I would have seen.) -> Minä '''en''' olisi nähnyt. (I would ''not'' have seen.)

::* Potential:
:::* Minä nähnen. (I probably see.) -> Minä '''en''' nähne. (I probably ''do not'' see.)
:::* Minä lienen nähnyt. (I have probably seen.) -> Minä '''en''' liene nähnyt. (I have probably ''not'' seen.)

===Etymology 1===
From {{etyl|dum|nl}} {{term|dat|lang=dum}}, which was contracted to {{term|'t|lang=dum}} in usual speech. This form was later interpreted as being the same as the neuter pronoun {{term|het|lang=nl}} (etymology 2, see below), which was contracted in the same way. This then led to the modern spelling beginning with ''h'', which is in fact unetymological.

==Hungarian==

===Etymology===
From Old Hungarian [[vagyon]] (same meaning). See Hungarian [[volt#Hungarian|volt]]

===Verb===
{{hu-verb}}

# [[be]], [[exist]]
# [[have]]; someone ''[[-nak]]/[[-nek]]'' has something ''[[-ja]]/[[-je]]''
#: ''Péter'''nek''' '''van''' egy kutyá'''ja'''.'' - “Peter has a dog” (literally 'There is a his dog for Peter' ([[sic]]))
# [[there is]]
#: '''''Van''' itt valaki?'' - “Is there anybody here?”

====Conjugation====
{{hu-conj-van}}

====Usage notes====
* Omission of van and vannak:
*: When using with an adjective (qualification), the forms ''van'' and ''vannak'' are not used (their place is left empty).
*::: ''Béla okos.'' - Béla is clever.
*:: It still appears if ''van''/''vannak'' is the [[w:Hungarian grammar#Emphasis|focus]] of the sentence. This happens when the sentence means that the property described by the adjective (e.g. strength) reaches or exceeds some specified level and this is emphasized by the speaker. In this case, the adjective is preceded by a word like ''olyan'' (such), ''annyira'' (that much), ''elég'' (enough).
*::: ''Béla '''van''' annyira erős, hogy felemelje a szekrényt.'' - Béla is strong enough to lift the cupboard.
*:: The forms other than ''van'' and ''vannak'' are always used.
*::: ''Béla okos '''volt'''.'' - Béla was clever.
*::: ''Okos '''vagyok'''.'' - I am clever.
*: Otherwise, all forms are used:
*:: With adverbs and [[w:adverbial participle|adverbial participles]] (suffixed ''[[-va]]''/''[[-ve]]'')
*::: ''Hogy '''van'''?'' - How is he? (also 'How are you?', formal singular)
*::: ''El '''van''' törve.'' - It is broken.
*:: Using in the "exists" or "there is" sense (and so with ''have'', which is expressed by ''there is'' in Hungarian)
*::: '''''Van''' egy ház a hegyen.'' - There is a house on the mountain.
*::: '''''Van''' egy kutyám.'' - I have a dog.

* The negative form is [[nincs]] or [[nincsen]] instead of ''* [[nem]] van'', and [[sincs]] or [[sincsen]] instead of ''* [[sem]] van''
*: '''''Nincs''' pénzem.'' - I don't have any money.

===Article===
{{head|nl|article}}

# {{archaic|lang=nl}} in idiom; a form of the definite article [[de]]
#: ''Te drommel'' — by Jove.

====Usage notes====

This preposition used to govern the dative case. It also fused with the dative forms of the definite article:

* (''at'', ''in'') [[ter]] = te + [[der]] for feminine singular.
* (''at'', ''in'') [[ten#Dutch|ten]] = te + [[den]] in all other cases.

Combinations with the nominative form of the article, like *''te het'' or *''te de'' have never become part of the language. The collapse of the inflection system and the related demise of the distinction between masculine and feminine gender (for most speakers) has pushed this preposition into partial disuse. It does however occur in a fair number of idiomatic expressions, often with fossilized case endings, e.g.:
: '''''te''' elfder ure.'' &mdash; at the eleventh hour.
: '''''te''' eigen bate'' &mdash; for one's own profit.

(''Elfder'', ''ure'' and ''bate'' are dative forms of [[elfde]], [[uur]] and [[baat]] resp.)

# {{personal|lang=fi}} [[you]] (''second-person plural; when addressing many persons or when addressing politely or formally one person'').

====Declension====
* Irregular. The [[comitative]] and [[instructive]] forms don't exist; the [[abessive]] is hardly used.
* In addition to the standard set of cases, '''''te''''' and other personal pronouns have a specific [[accusative]] form, ''[[teidät]]''.

{{fi-decl-pron|1s=[[sinä]]|2s=[[sinun]]|3s=[[sinua]]|4s=[[sinut]]|5s=[[sinussa]]|6s=[[sinusta]]|7s=[[sinuun]]|8s=[[sinulla]]|9s=[[sinulta]]|10s=[[sinulle]]|11s=[[sinuna]]|12s=[[sinuksi]]|14s=[[sinutta]]|1p='''te'''|2p=[[teidän]]|3p=[[teitä]]|4p=[[teidät]]|5p=[[teissä]]|6p=[[teistä]]|7p=[[teihin]]|8p=[[teillä]]|9p=[[teiltä]]|10p=[[teille]]|11p=[[teinä]]|12p=[[teiksi]]|14p=[[teittä]]|adv=no}}

====Usage notes====
* Depending on the context, the pronoun can sometimes be omitted in written language if the text remains fluent &ndash; the pronoun is in spoken language practically always used (compare the usage of ''[[sinä]]'', "you" (sg.)).
* When addressing politely or formally one person in a written form, it is recommendable to capitalize the pronoun ''Te''.
* When addressing one person, the active past participle must be ''singular'' in negative past indicative, in present perfect of all moods both affirmative and negative and past perfect indicative &mdash; because there is ''one'' person addressed:
:* '''Te''' [[ette]] ''[[ollut]]'' [[täällä]] [[silloin]]. {{qualifier|negative past indicative}}
:** ''You were'' not here at that time.
:* '''Te''' [[olette]] ''[[ollut]]'' [[täällä]] [[silloin]]. {{qualifier|affirmative present perfect indicative}}

===Etymology 2===
[[File:Craps.jpg|thumb|250px|upright|A pair of common dice with six sides each.]]
[[File:Dice (typical role playing game dice).jpg|thumb|250px|upright|Various dice with different numbers of sides and distributions of values.]]

From {{etyl|enm}} {{term|dee}}, from {{etyl|fro}} {{term|de|lang=fro}} (Modern French {{term|dé}}), from {{etyl|la}} {{term|datum}}, from {{term|datus||given}}, the past participle of {{term|dare||to give}}, from {{etyl|ine-pro|en}} {{recons|deh₃-||to lay out, to spread out|lang=ine-pro}}.

====Noun====
{{en-noun|dies|pl2=dice}}

# (''plural:'' dice) A [[polyhedron]], usually a [[cube]], with [[number]]s or [[symbol]]s on each side and used in [[game of chance|games of chance]].
#* '''1748'''. David Hume. [[s:An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding|Enquiry concerning the human understanding]]. In: ''Wikisource''. Wikimedia: 2007. § 46.
#*: If a '''die''' were marked with one figure or number of spots on four sides, and with another figure or number of spots on the two remaining sides, it would be more probable, that the former would turn up than the latter;
# (''plural:'' dies) The [[cubical]] part of a [[pedestal]], a [[plinth]].
# (''plural:'' dies) A [[device]] for [[cut]]ting into a [[specify|specified]] [[shape]].
# A [[device]] used to [[cut]] an [[external]] [[screw thread]]. (Internal screw threads are cut with a [[tap]].)
# (''plural:'' dies) A mold for forming metal or plastic objects.
# (''plural:'' dies) An [[emboss]]ed [[device]] used in [[stamp]]ing [[coin]]s and [[medal]]s.
# (''plural:'' dice ''or'' dies) A fragment of a completed [[integrated circuit]] [[wafer]], among those produced by fracturing the wafer as specified in its design, that includes a portion that (unless defective) can provide the electronic function for which it was designed, but whose further mechanical subdivision would irreversibly impair that function.

=====Usage notes=====
The game of dice is singular. Thus in "Dice is a game played with dice," the first occurrence is singular, the second occurrence is plural. Otherwise, using the plural {{term|dice}} as a singular instead of {{term|die}} is considered incorrect by most authorities, but has come into widespread use.

===Etymology===
A merger of {{etyl|odt|nl}} {{term|thie|lang=odt}}, {{term|the|thē|lang=odt}}, {{term|thia|lang=odt}}, {{term|thiu|lang=odt}} and similar forms of the demonstrative. As in {{etyl|goh|-}} {{term|ther|lang=goh}}, {{term|der|lang=goh}} it replaced the original masculine and feminine nominative forms from {{etyl|gem-pro|nl}} {{recons|sa|lang=gem-pro}}.

#: '''''die''' boom''
#:: '''that''' tree
#: '''''die''' vrouw''
#:: '''that''' woman
# [[those]] (plural); {{non-gloss definition|referring to things or people further away.}}

#:: Don't know any people '''who''' can do that.
#: ''Oh, maar ik ken iemand '''die''' dat wel kan!''
#:: Oh, but I know somebody '''who''' can!

====Usage notes====
A preceding comma may alter the meaning of a clause starting with a relative pronoun. Compare the following sentences:

* ''Alle arbeiders '''die''' staken zullen op sancties moeten rekenen.''
*: All workers '''who''' are striking should reckon on sanctions.
* ''Alle arbeiders, '''die''' staken, zullen op sancties moeten rekenen.''
*: All workers, '''who''' are striking, should reckon on sanctions.

In the first sentence, only the striking workers are advised to reckon on sanctions. In the second sentence, the parenthetical phrase indicates that all the workers are striking and all should reckon on sanctions.
